A. saliva no longer occurs in the wild, but related species of Avena occur in Europe and the Fertile Crescent region of the Near East. Cultivation appears to have started roughly 2,000 years ago during the Bronze Age in Celtic and Germanic regions of Europe, and emanated to other temperate and cold regions (Hedrick 1919). Oats appear to have originated as a weed in fields of other cultivated grains, including wheat and barley. Oats are grown in temperate regions worldwide, with a 2009 total harvest of 23.3 million tons produced on 10.2 million hectares; leading producers are the Russian Federation, Canada, and the U.S. (FAOSTAT 2011). Total area cultivated with oats has declined since 1950 (IndexMundi 2011), with a concurrent increase in soybeans (Glycine max).\r\n\r\nOats are used as food for humans, in oatmeal (porridge), cereals, and cookies.

Painted turtles are medium-sized turtles (10 to 18 cm). Males are smaller than females; adult males average from 170 to 190 g, whereas adult females average from 260 to 330 g in some populations (Congdon et al., 1986; Ernst 1971b). In general, the shell comprises approximately 30 percent of the total wet weight of turtles of this size (Hall, 1924). \r\n\r\nPainted turtle habitat requirements include soft and muddy bottoms, basking sites, and aquatic vegetation (Sexton, 1959). Painted turtles prefer slow-moving shallow water such as ponds, marshes, ditches, prairie sloughs, spring runs, canals, and occasionally brackish tidal marshes (Conant and Collins, 1991). They frequent areas with floating surface vegetation for feeding and for cover (Sexton, 1959). These areas tend to be warmer than more open water, which is important in the early fall as temperatures begin to drop (Sexton, 1959). For winter hibernation or dormancy, painted turtles seek deeper water (Sexton, 1959). If outlying marsh areas are dry during the summer, the turtles may return to the more permanent bodies of water sooner (McAuliffe, 1978). Painted turtles sometimes inhabit stagnant and polluted water (Smith, 1956).\r\n\r\nPainted turtles are omnivorous. Depending on habitat and on age, painted turtles may consume predominantly vegetation or predominantly animal matter. Marchand (1942, cited in Mahmoud and Klicka, 1979) found in one population that juveniles consumed approximately 85 percent animal matter and 15 percent plant matter, whereas the adults were primarily herbivorous, consuming 88 percent plant matter and 12 percent insects and amphipods. \r\n\r\nPainted turtles are diurnal and usually spend their nights sleeping submerged (Ernst, 1971c). During the day, they forage in the late morning and late afternoon and bask during the rest of the day (Ernst, 1971c). Active feeding does not occur until water temperatures approach 20 degrees C, and these turtles are most active around 20.7 to 22.4 degrees C (Ernst, 1972; Ernst and Barbour, 1972; Hutchinson, 1979). Basking is most frequent in the spring, summer, and fall, but occasionally painted turtles bask during warm spells in the winter (Ernst and Barbour, 1972). \r\n\r\nMost painted turtles become dormant during the colder months but will become active during warm periods in the winter (Ernst and Barbour, 1972).", "sid": 795380, "picture": "http://media.eol.org/content/2015/01/16/13/98011_orig.jpg", "scientific_name": "Chrysemys picta (Schneider, 1783)", "web_url": "http://www.eol.org/pages/795380", "thumb": "http://media.eol.org/content/2015/01/16/13/98011_98_68.jpg"}, "1049620": {"common_name": "Gal\u00e1pagos penguin", "text": "The Galapagos penguin is the most northerly of all penguins, occurring on the Galapagos Islands, on the equator (3).

It is native to western North America, mostly near the Pacific coast, from southernmost Alaska to southern California. Some stands are also found inland in the foothills of the Sierra Nevada mountains of central California, and a tiny population occurs in central Idaho.Bigleaf maple can grow up to 35 m tall, but more commonly grows 15 m to 20 m tall. The flowers are produced in spring in pendulous racemes 10\u201315 cm long, greenish-yellow with inconspicuous petals. The fruit is a paired samara (winged nutlet), each seed 1-1.5 cm diameter with a 4\u20135 cm wing.Bigleaf maple can form pure stands on moist soils in proximity to streams, but is generally found in mixed stands in riparian hardwood forests or in relatively open canopies of conifers, mixed evergreens, or oaks (Quercus spp.). It is dominant or codominant in cool and moist temperate mixed woods.Bigleaf maple is the only commercially important maple of the Pacific Coast region, although in some areas, it is not considered valuable and may be left unharvested or intentionally knocked over during harvest of Douglas fir (Pseudotsuga menziesii) and redwood (Sequoia spp.) stands. The wood, which is light, reddish-brown, fine-grained, moderately heavy, and moderately hard and strong, is primarily used in veneer production for furniture, but also for musical instruments, interior paneling, and other hardwood products. Lakwungen First Nations people of Vancouver Island call it the Paddle Tree and used it to make paddles and spindle wheels.Like other maples, bigleaf has a sugary sap from which maple syrup can be made. The sugar concentration is about the same as in Acer saccharum (sugar maple), with a similar ratio of sap to syrup (it takes 35\u201340 liters sap to make 1 liter syrup), but the flavor is somewhat different and there is limited commercial interest in it. (See Wikipedia article in full entry for information about ethnobotanic and medicinal uses.) The seeds provide food for squirrels, evening grosbeaks, chipmunks, mice, and a variety of birds. Elk, black-tailed and mule deer, and horses browse the young twigs, leaves, and saplings. In some forest stands, up to 60% of the seedlings over 10 inches (25 cm) tall have been browsed by deer, most several times.Acer species are sometimes classified in their own family, Aceraceae, but have been grouped in Sapindaceae (along with Hippocastanaceae) in the most recent version of the Angiosperm Phyologeny Group system (Stevens 2001). \u201cMacrophyllum\u201d refers to the fact that the leaves are large\u2014the largest of any maple species.", "sid": 582252, "picture": "http://media.eol.org/content/2012/06/13/21/17395_orig.jpg", "scientific_name": "Acer macrophyllum Pursh", "web_url": "http://www.eol.org/pages/582252", "thumb": "http://media.eol.org/content/2012/06/13/21/17395_98_68.jpg"}, "328570": {"common_name": "minke whale", "text": "The Northern minke whale (Balaenoptera acutorostrata), is a very large cetacean, in the family of Rorquals (Balaenoptera). The Minke is a baleen whale, meaning that instead of teeth, it has long plates which hang in a row (like the teeth of a comb) from its upper jaws. Baleen plates are strong and flexible; they are made of a protein similar to human fingernails.  Baleen plates are broad at the base (gumline) and taper into a fringe which forms a curtain or mat inside the whale's mouth. Baleen whales strain huge volumes of ocean water through their baleen plates to capture food: tons of krill, other zooplankton, crustaceans, and small fish.The smallest of the rorqual whales (and the second-smallest baleen whale), the minke whale is also the most abundant. Two species are now recognised, the northern hemisphere minke whale (the subject of this species page) and the southern hemisphere Antarctic minke whale (Balaenoptera bonaerensis). Minke whales are slim in shape, with a pointed dolphin-like head, bearing a double blow-hole. The smooth skin is dark grey above, while the belly and undersides of the flippers are white, and there is often a white band on the flipper. When seen at close quarters, minke whales have variable smoky patterns which have been used to photo-identify individuals.Minke whales feed on fish and various invertebrates; like all baleen whales they filter their food from the water using their baleen plates like sieves. Although largely a solitary species, when feeding minke whales can often be seen in pairs, and on particularly good feeding grounds up to a hundred individuals may congregate. A number of feeding techniques have been observed, including trapping shoals of fish against the surface of the water. After a ten month gestation period, births occur in mid-winter, at birth the calf measures up to 2.8 metres in length. It will be weaned at four months of age, and will stay with its mother for up to two years, becoming sexually mature at seven years of age. Minke whales have an average life span of around 50 years.

Australia has the most problems with European rabbits, due to the lack of natural predators there.\u00a0 Although world-wide this species is frequently eradicated as a populous pest, it is listed as Near Threatened on the IUCN red list, because the designation is based on the population in its native range, which is declining due to \"disease, habitat loss and human-induced mortality\" (Smith and Boyer 2008).\u00a0 Its decline in its native range has caused subsequent decline of its highly dependent predators, the Iberian lynx and the Spanish Imperial eagle.\u00a0\r\n\r\nThe European rabbit is well known for digging networks of burrows, called warrens, where it spends most of its time when not feeding.

A juvenile will eat insect larva, plankton, and small crustaceans while a larger adult may eat small fish and crayfish.\r\n\r\nIn the late fall the female will scoop out a shallow hole in the gravel of the streambed or lake bottom around the shoreline. The male and female together then extrude eggs and milt into the hole, the female then covering the fertilized eggs (100 to 5000, depending on her size) to incubate them during the winter. In two or three months the surviving eggs hatch. The young go through a couple of stages before they reach adulthood.

In its range, the Cooper\u2019s Hawk is one of the most numerous and adaptable raptors. While usually found in forest habitats, this species has expanded into human-altered landscapes and now frequents towns and suburbs as well. The Cooper\u2019s Hawk is a \u2018bird hawk\u2019 capable of hunting birds from the air, and frequently enters yards to take small songbirds from feeders. With the aid of binoculars, Cooper\u2019s Hawks may be seen perched in trees while scanning for prey. However, they are often more easily seen in the air while moving between perches or while actively hunting.

Ospreys are often seen flying over water searching for prey, then hovering and plunging feet first to capture a fish in their talons (fish are normally carried head first and belly down). Bald Eagles may sometimes chase them and force them to drop their catch. During migration, Ospreys may be seen far from water, even over deserts. Migrants travel singly, not in flocks. \r\n\r\nThe Osprey's diet consists almost entirely of fish, generally in the range of 10 to 30 cm in length. Rarely, small mammals, birds, or reptiles may be eaten. \r\n\r\nOspreys breed in the New World over most of North America south to Guatemala; in the Old World, they breed from the British Isles, Scandinavia, northern Russia, and northern Siberia south (at least locally) through much of Eurasia and most of Africa and Australia to South Africa, the Himalayas, Tasmania, New Caledonia, and the Solomon Islands. They winter from the southern United States south through Middle America, the West Indies, and South America (including the Galapagos Islands) to southern Chile, northern Argentina, and Uruguay; in the Old World, Ospreys winter from the Mediterranean, Black, and Caspian Seas, India, and eastern China south through the remainder of the breeding range. \r\n\r\nThe Osprey's courtship display includes the pair circling high together; the male may fly high and then dive repeatedly in the vicinity of the nest site, often carrying a fish or stick. The nest is usually constructed at the top of a large tree (often with a dead or broken top) not far from water. Utility poles or other structures, including nesting platforms erected by humans expressly for Ospreys, may also be used. They may nest on the ground on small islands and on cliffs or giant cacti in western Mexico. The nest site is typically very open to the sky. The bulky nest, built by both sexes, is made of sticks and lined with smaller materials. Nests may be reused for many years, with material added each year. Typical clutch size is 3 (range 2 to 4). The eggs, which are creamy white with brown blotches, are incubated by both parents (but mainly the female) for around 38 days. When the young first hatch, the female remains with them most of the time, sheltering them from sun and rain, and the male brings fish back to the nest, which the female feeds the young. Age at first flight is around 51 to 54 days. \r\n\r\nIn the mid-20th century, Osprey populations in the United States and elsewhere plummeted as a result of accumulations of the pesticide DDT in the food chain, which prevented the formation of normal eggshells (DDT can interfere with normal calcium absorption, resulting in thin eggshells). With the reduction in use of DDT and other conservation efforts, populations of Ospreys and some other affected species have rebounded.\r\n\r\n (Kaufman 1996; AOU 1998; Dunn and Alderfer 2011)\r\n", "sid": 1049145, "picture": "http://media.eol.org/content/2013/02/01/16/41345_orig.jpg", "scientific_name": "Pandion haliaetus", "web_url": "http://www.eol.org/pages/1049145", "thumb": "http://media.eol.org/content/2013/02/01/16/41345_98_68.jpg"}, "311569": {"common_name": "Spotted Hyena", "text": "One of the most misunderstood animals; spotted hyenas have a reputation as being sly and cowardly, but are in fact fascinating and intelligent with a remarkable social system (2).

However, evidence of extensive interbreeding where the ranges of these forms come into contact (as well as shifting philosophical views about species definitions) led to the \"lumping\"  of the Yellow-shafted and Red-shafted Flickers.  \"Yellow-shafted\" Flickers have yellow wing linings and undertail, gray crown, and tan face, with a red crescent on the nape; the male has a black moustachial stripe. \"Red-shafted\" Flickers have a brown crown and gray face, with no red crescent on the nape; the male has a red moustachial stripe.  In the western Great Plains, there is a broad zone where all the flickers are intergrades, showing a mix of Yellow-shafted and Red-shafted characteristics. Another currently recognized species, the Gilded Flicker (Colaptes chrysoides), was formely treated as falling within C. auratus.

Flickers are often seen foraging on the ground. \r\n\r\nMale Northern Flickers defend their nesting territory with calling, drumming, and aggressive displays (swinging the head back and forth, flicking the wings open and spreading the tail to show its bright underside). Courtship and aggressive displays are largely similar.  The commonly heard call on the breeding ground is a long, loud series of \"wicka\" notes; other vocalizations may be heard year-round.\r\n\r\nNorthern Flickers typically nest in cavities in dead trees or wooden posts (they may rarely nest in a ground burrow).

Adults also feed on carrion of any size.  The reasons for the species' dramatic decline are not entirely certain, but evidence points increasingly to a cascade of changes in vertebrate communities resulting from habitat fragmentation and other human-caused disturbances.

The plumage ranges from all white (some old males) to white with many dark bars and spots (particularly in females and immatures). \r\n\r\nThis is a bird of the open Arctic tundra of both the New World and Old World. Snowy Owls nest on the ground and feed mainly on lemmings, which they hunt both day and night (other mammals and birds are also eaten, as well as some fish and carrion). In winter, there is some movement south and individuals are seen at least  irregularly south to the northern United States (and even, rarely, the Gulf Coast), Iceland, the British Isles, northern continental Europe, central Russia, northern China, and Sakhalin. These wandering winter birds are generally seen in open country such as prairie, marshes, fields, pastures, and sandy beaches.  In years when lemming populations crash, many Snowy Owls move south to the northern tier of states in the United States and some go much farther. These wandering birds (usually heavily barred younger birds) often perch on the ground, low stumps, or buildings. \r\n\r\nIn many Arctic regions, Snowy Owls breed mainly in years when lemmings are abundant and fail to nest at all when lemmings are scarce. Although Snowy Owls are silent off the breeding grounds, males defend their breeding territories with deep hooting in early spring. A courting male flies with deep, slow wingbeats, often with a lemming in his bill; reaching the female, he leans forward and partly raises his wings. The nest site is typically a mound or ridge in hilly country or a hummock in low-lying areas. It is always in very open tundra with high visibility. The same site may be used for several years. The nest (which is built by the female) is a simple depression in the tundra with no lining added.  Clutch size is highly variable (3 to 11 eggs) and correlated with prey abundance. The eggs are whitish, but become stained in the nest. The female incubates the eggs for 31 to 33 days and the male brings food to the incubating female. Egg hatch is not synchronized, so the female cares for her first young while still incubating her last eggs.  The female remains with the young and the male brings her food, which the female feeds them.  The young may leave the nest after 2 to 3 weeks, but they are not able to fly until around 7 weeks and are fed by their parents until at least 9 or 10 weeks.\r\n\r\nAlthough most North American Snowy Owl breeding areas are far from major human disturbance, this species has declined in parts of its breeding range in northern Europe.\r\n\r\n(Kaufman 1996; AOU 1998; Dunn and Alderfer 2011)", "sid": 1036388, "picture": "http://media.eol.org/content/2013/03/07/15/37276_orig.jpg", "scientific_name": "Bubo scandiacus", "web_url": "http://www.eol.org/pages/1036388", "thumb": "http://media.eol.org/content/2013/03/07/15/37276_98_68.jpg"}, "330984": {"common_name": "Strawberry Poison-dart Frog", "text": "Oophaga pumilio are slender frogs with bilateral symmetry.

Leopards are found throughout Africa where there is sufficient cover and from the Arabian Peninsula through Asia to Manchuria and Korea. In the African rainforests and Sri Lanka, the Leopard is the only large predator. The black spot seen in the center of each rosette on a Jaguar's coat is typically lacking in Leopards. Melanistic Leopards (\"black panthers\"; melanistic Jaguars may also be referred to by this name) sometimes occur in several parts of Africa, but are more common in Thailand, Malaysia, and Java (Indonesia). \r\n\r\nLeopards are found in an extraordinary range of habitats. In sub-Saharan Africa, they may be found in any habitats with annual rainfall greater than 50 mm, as well as along rivers penetrating true deserts. Leopards in the Kalahari Desert can reportedly go 10 days without drinking. In deserts with temperatures reaching 70 C, Leopards can survive by seeking shelter during the day in caves, animal burrows, and dense vegetation. In Central and West Africa, Leopards occur in rainforests receiving more than 1500 mm annual rainfall. Leopards are common throughout the Indian subcontinent in savannahs, acacia grasslands, deciduous and evergreen forests, and scrub woodlands. They may occur to 5200 m elevation in the mountains of Pakistan and Kashmir. In Southeast Asia, they occur in dense primary rainforest, among other habitats. In the Russian Far East, they may be found in forested mountainous regions where the snow is less than 15 cm deep. Leopards are capable of persisting in close proximity to humans. \r\n\r\nThe diet of the Leopard is highly varied, including both large and small prey. It often consists mainly of small and medium-sized mammals (5 to 45 kg), but may range from large beetles to ungulates (hoofed mammals) several times their size. Most hunting occurs at night. Sunquist and Sunquist (2009) review the diet of Leopards as reported from different portions of their range.\r\n\r\nLike other felids (i.e., members of the cat family), Leopards commonly kill their prey with a bite to the throat, although smaller prey may be dispatched with a bite to the nape or back of the head. Large prey items may be dragged up into a tree and cached there, especially in Africa, where carcasses may otherwise be taken over by hyenas or lions. In Sri Lanka, where the Leopard is the only large carnivore, Leopards are reportedly often seen in open areas during the day. \r\n\r\nIn the wild, mating associations last just a day or two. The gestation period is around 96 days and young are born at 400 to 600 g. Litter size is typically one to three young (usually two, maximum six). Young travel with their mother starting at three to six months (when they weigh around three or four kg) and begin to eat meat. Permanent canines are emerged at around seven to eight months and the young are typically independent by 12 to 18 months (athough sometimes significantly later). Sexual maturity is reached at two to three years of age. \r\n\r\nIn some parts of their range, Leopards are endangered, whereas in other places they are considered pests. \r\n\r\n(Estes 1991; Sunquist and Sunquist 2009)", "sid": 328673, "picture": "http://media.eol.org/content/2014/10/11/05/59143_orig.jpg", "scientific_name": "Panthera pardus (Linnaeus, 1758)", "web_url": "http://www.eol.org/pages/328673", "thumb": "http://media.eol.org/content/2014/10/11/05/59143_98_68.jpg"}, "915105": {"common_name": "greater roadrunner", "text": "The Greater Roadrunner (Geococcyx californianus), one of two roadrunner species, is found in Mexico and the southwestern and southcentral United States. It is a large, ground-dwelling member of the cuckoo family. The Greater Roadrunner walks and runs on the ground, flying only when necessary. It can run 15 mph (24 kph) and probably sprints briefly at much higher speeds in pursuit of prey. Greater Roadrunners are common in scrub desert and mesquite groves, less common in chaparral and open woodland.\r\n\r\nThe diet of the Greater Roadrunner consists of insects and other arthropods, lizards, snakes, rodents, small birds, and sometimes snails. Some fruits (especially cactus fruit) and seeds are also eaten. In addition to making rapid dashes to grab a prey item with its bill, the Greater Roadrunner may leap straight up from the ground to catch insects or small birds flying over (roadrunners have been observed capturing hummingbirds this way). \r\n\r\nGreater Roadrunners may mate for life, with a pair defending its territory all year. Courtship includes chases on foot, with frequent pauses to rest. One member of the pair approaches the other with a stick or blade of grass and drops it on the ground or gives to the other bird. In other displays, the male runs away from the female with his tail and wings raised over his back and gradually lowers his wings; the male wags his tail from side to side while slowly bowing. \r\n\r\nThe nest is constructed in a dense bush, low tree, or cactus, usually around 1 to 4 m above the ground (rarely on the ground itself). The nest is a platform of sticks lined with grass, leaves, and feathers and sometimes with pieces of snakeskin or cow manure. The 3 to 5 eggs (sometimes 2 or 6) are white to pale yellowish and are incubated by both parents (but especially the male) for around 20 days. Both parents feed the young, which leave the nest after around 18 to 21 days after hatching. Although young birds may begin capturing their own food shortly after leaving the nest, they are still fed by the parents for another 30 to 40 days. \r\n\r\nGreater Roadrunners are permanent (i.e., year-round) residents across their range, but some individuals may wander considerable distances. Although the range of the Greater Roadrunner periodically expands to the north and east, it is pushed back by severe winters. This species may be in long-term decline in California.\r\n\r\nThe Greater Roadrunner, with its long tail, expressive crest, and speedy gait,  provided inspiration for a popular cartoon character who not only entertains, but also provides opportunities for meaningful discussions of the laws of physics  and literary analysis.\r\n\r\n(Kaufman 1996; AOU 1998; Dunn and Alderfer 2011)", "sid": 915105, "picture": "http://media.eol.org/content/2013/08/23/22/86102_orig.jpg", "scientific_name": "Geococcyx californianus (Lesson, 1829)", "web_url": "http://www.eol.org/pages/915105", "thumb": "http://media.eol.org/content/2013/08/23/22/86102_98_68.jpg"}, "327959": {"common_name": "Long-tailed Macaque", "text": "The crab-eating macaque (Macaca fascicularis), also known as the long-tailed macaque, is a cercopithecine primate native to Southeast Asia.

Populations as little as five kilometres apart are as genetically distinct as separate species, a consequence of the Banggai cardinalfish's highly limited dispersal capability, the strong currents and deep channels between the islands preventing interaction with populations at other sites (4) (5) (6).\u00a0Banggai cardinalfish live in small groups of usually between 1 and 6 individuals, though a group of 500 has been recorded (1).  Reproduction in the Banggai cardinalfish begins with the female choosing a male; the pair then separate from the group and establish a territory, aggressively defending it from other fish that come too close. The female then initiates an unusual courtship ritual, swimming alongside the male, bodies touching, and making a trembling motion. This behaviour occurs repeatedly on both sides, with the only signs of the male's receptivity being a darkening of the lower jaw and an occasional opening of the mouth (7). After several hours of this behaviour, the female spawns a mass of up to 75 large eggs (a very small number for a marine fish). These are quickly swallowed by the male, and brooded in a special pouch inside the mouth (2). The eggs take about 20 days to hatch, after which, the newly hatched embryos continue to develop in the male's mouth pouch. After a further 10 days, when the young have reached around five to six millimetres in length, they are released (1). During the 30-day brooding period the male does not eat, and attends to the brood by frequently turning the eggs and expelling dead eggs and embryos. Once the brood are released, the male does not interact with them anymore (7). The small juveniles are most commonly found sheltering around sea anemones for protection. However, older juveniles and adults are more commonly found around branching corals and sea urchins (2) (8).\u00a0The Banggai cardinalfish feeds principally upon tiny planktonic crustaceans, with copepods, in particular, making up about 80 percent of the diet. Nevertheless, this species is an opportunistic feeder, and will take a variety of small organisms from the water column and the seabed, including marine worms, molluscs and fish larvae. In addition, it plays an important role in its environment by preying on the larval stages of coral reef fishes' parasites (9). The Banggai cardinalfish is preyed upon by various species, such as the crocodile-fish (Cymbacephalus beauforti), various lion-fish species (genus Pterois) and the grouper (Epinephelus merra) (1).

The forest buffalo, due  to its more restricted habitat, forms small groups of up to 12 animals, consisting of related females and their offspring and one or more males (2).  Males not belonging to a herd are solitary, or form bachelor herds (2).  Living in a herd has its advantages; information can be shared regarding the best places to feed, and it offers increased protection against predators (6).  Bonds between females in a herd are strong (2), and if one is attacked by a predator such as a lion, the rest of the herd will respond to its bellowing distress calls and rush to its defence.  A herd of buffalo are easily capable of driving away a whole pride of lions to protect a herd member (5).   Living in large herds is not as important for the forest buffalo as they live in a habitat that does not suit carnivores, such as the lion, and they can easily retreat into cover if required (2).\u00a0African buffalos spend most of their day lying in the shade to escape the heat.  They can often be found drinking water in the early morning and late afternoon, and most feeding takes place during the cooler night (3).  The African buffalo grazes extensively on fresh grass, turning only to herbs, shrubs and trees when there is a deficiency of grass (5).  Their dietary habits are responsible for opening up areas of long grassland for other species with more selective feeding habits, and thus they play an important ecological role in the savannas of sub-Saharan Africa (5).\u00a0March to May is the primary period of mating in the African buffalo, resulting in a pregnancy of about 11 months (2), with calves born from January to April (5).  The bond between the mother and calf is very strong (2), and within just a few hours, the newborn calf is capable of keeping up with its herd (3).

They are found throughout Mexico, Central America, the United States, except at the higher elevations of the Rocky Mountains, and into southern Canada (Kaufmann, 1982). During the last 50 years, raccoon populations in the United States have increased greatly (Sanderson, 1987). In suburban areas, they frequently raid garbage cans and dumps. Raccoons are preyed on by bobcats, coyotes, foxes, and great horned owls (Kaufmann, 1982). Twenty-five subspecies are recognized in the United States and Canada; however, most researchers do not identify the subspecies studied because different subspecies inhabit essentially nonoverlapping geographic ranges.\r\n\r\nRaccoons measure from 46 to 71 cm with a 20 to 30 cm tail. Body weights vary by location, age, and sex from 3 to 9 kg (Kaufmann, 1982; Sanderson, 1987).\r\n\r\nRaccoons are found near virtually every aquatic habitat, particularly in hardwood swamps, mangroves, floodplain forests, and freshwater and saltwater marshes (Kaufmann, 1982). They are also common in suburban residential areas and cultivated and abandoned farmlands (Kaufmann, 1982) and may forage in farmyards (Greenwood, 1982). Stuewer (1943a) stated that a permanent water supply, tree dens, and available food are essential. Raccoons use surface waters for both drinking and foraging (Stuewer, 1943a).\r\n\r\nThe raccoon is an omnivorous and opportunistic feeder. Although primarily active from sunset to sunrise (Kaufmann, 1982; Stuewer, 1943a), raccoons will change their activity period to accommodate the availability of food and water (Sanderson, 1987). For example, salt marsh raccoons may become active during the day to take advantage of low tide (Ivey, 1948, cited in Sanderson, 1987). Raccoons feed primarily on fleshy fruits, nuts, acorns, and corn (Kaufmann, 1982) but also eat grains, insects, frogs, crayfish, eggs, and virtually any animal and vegetable matter (Palmer and Fowler, 1975). The proportion of different foods in their diet depends on location and season, although plants are usually a more important component of the diet. They may focus on a preferred food, such as turtle eggs, when it is available (Stuewer, 1943a). They also will feed on garbage and carrion. Typically, it is only in the spring and early summer that raccoons eat more animal than plant material. Their late summer and fall diets consist primarily of fruits. In winter, acorns tend to be the most important food, although raccoons will take any corn or fruits that are still available (Kaufmann, 1982; Stuewer, 1943a).", "sid": 328598, "picture": "http://media.eol.org/content/2013/01/24/10/86040_orig.jpg", "scientific_name": "Procyon lotor (Linnaeus, 1758)", "web_url": "http://www.eol.org/pages/328598", "thumb": "http://media.eol.org/content/2013/01/24/10/86040_98_68.jpg"}, "1052056": {"common_name": "Common Grackle", "text": "The Common Grackle (Quiscalus quiscula) is an abundant and gregarious blackbird found in partly open situations with scattered trees, open coniferous and deciduous woodlands, forest edges, and suburbs. It breeds across approximately the eastern two thirds of Canada (from Alberta to southern Quebec) and the United States (from Montana, Colorado and easten New Mexico to the Atlantic and Gulf Coasts), with the winter range contracting to the southeast of the much broader breeding range. The range has been expanding westward in recent decades. Two forms (both appearing all black at a distance) were at one time recognized as distinct species: The \"Bronzed Grackle\", which occurs in most of New England and west of the Appalachians, has a bronze back, blue head, and purple tail; the smaller \"Purple Grackle\", found east of the Appalachians, has a narrow bill, purple head, bottle green back, and purple tail. Birds from the mid-Atlantic states show variable head color and a purplish back with iridescent bands of variable color. The familiar song of the Common Grackle resembles the sound of a creaking gate; the call note is a loud, deep chuck.\r\n\r\nCommon Grackles are omnivorous . They forage mainly by walking on the ground or wading in very shallow water. Outside the breeding season, they usually forage in flocks. \r\n\r\nCommon Grackles often nest in small colonies of 10 to 30 pairs  (sometimes as many as 100 or more) and several males may perch in adjacent treetops to sing their creaking, grating songs. In courtship, the male fluffs out his body feathers, partly spreads his wings and tail, and delivers a short scraping song; he also postures with his bill pointing straight up. The nest is typically built in dense vegetation less than 6 m above the ground. The nest, which is built by the female, is a bulky open cup of weeds, grass, and twigs, usually with some mud added, and the inside is lined with fine grass. The 4 to 5 (sometimes as few as two or as many as 6) pale blue eggs are blotched with brown. Incubation is by the female only for 12 to 14 days. Both parents feed the young, bringing them mostly insects. The young leave the nest around 16 to 20 days after hatching. \r\n\r\nCommon Grackles are present year-round across much of their range.

Platypus is an anglicised Greek word meaning flat foot, probably referring to the web on its feet.  Unfortunately this name had already been applied to a genus of beetles, so it had to be changed. Ornithorhynchus (bird-snout) replaced it, but the species name anatinus (duck-like) remained the same.The original specimen described by Shaw is currently stored with our research collections.MorphologyNo other animal on Earth looks quite like the platypus. The most distinctive feature is the bill, which is not hard like the bill of a duck but soft and pliable. It is well supplied with nerves and is used by the animal to locate food and to find its way around under water.Platypuses lose their deciduous juvenile teeth a short time after the young leave the nesting burrows. They are replaced by horny pads made of keratin.Built for swimming and diggingPlatypuses are covered with dense, waterproof fur, except on their feet and bill. They have a streamlined shape, short limbs and propels themselves through the water using alternate kicks of their webbed front limbs. These webs of the forefeet are folded back when the animal is walking or burrowing to expose strong claws.Behind the bill on either side of the head are 2 grooves that house the ear openings and the eyes which close when the platypus dives. The nostrils are on top of the bill, not far back from the tip.The skeleton is streamlined but heavy enough to support large muscles for swimming and digging. Other key featuresEach of the males\u2019 rear legs bears a horny spur on the ankle of about 1.5cm in length. This hollow spur is connected to a venom gland in the upper leg.The tail consists mainly of fatty tissue and acts as a fat storage area.Interestingly, the platypus skeleton shows reptilian and marsupial features:Between the collar bone and the sternum the platypus has a distinctively T-shape bone called the interclavicle, which is also found in modern reptiles.Like marsupials, the platypus has two epipubic bones attached to its pelvic girdle.The legs are splayed rather like those of reptiles but they rotate in their sockets like those of mammals.

Often several nurse sharks may congregate when resting, sometimes even piling on top of one another (2).  At night however, the nurse shark actively roams the sea bottom and reef for prey.  It feeds on bottom invertebrates such as spiny lobsters, shrimps, crabs, sea urchins, squid and octopi (2).  It is also feeds on fish, its nocturnal nature enabling it to prey on resting fish that would be too active during the day to capture (2).  The nurse shark's small mouth and large pharynx enable it to feed by a unique suction method, effectively making the nurse shark the 'hoover' of the ocean floor.  By cupping its mouth over a hole or crevice and expanding its throat, it creates a vacuum that sucks prey out of their hiding (4).  This suction-feeding is also useful for extracting snails from their shells (2), and it will dig in sand to root out prey sensed by its fleshy barbels (2).\u00a0The nurse shark is one of few sharks in which courtship behaviour is relatively well known (4).  The male swims alongside the female, grabs one of the pectoral fins in his mouth, rolls her over and they mate (4).  A large number of males will often try to mate with a single female, and females often bear numerous bite-scars and bruises received during mating attempts.  It is therefore not surprising that females frequently try to avoid males by swimming in very shallow water, where they can bury their pectoral fins in the sand (5).\u00a0Nurse sharks are ovoviviparous (2), a method of reproduction whereby the young develop inside a weakly-formed egg shell within the mother, receiving nourishment from  their yolk sac, for five to six months (2).  The females move to shallow seagrass beds and coral reefs to give birth to 20 to 30 pups in late spring and summer (2).

Although Great Gray Owls are most active at dawn, at dusk, and at night, they hunt during daylight in summer (and in winter if food-stressed), although still generally near dawn or dusk.  Wingbeats are deep and slow. Both sexes produce a call consisting of 5 to 10 very quiet (typically inaudible beyond 400 m) evenly spaced deep hoots at a rate of around one per second.\r\n\r\nThe diet of the Great Gray Owl consists mainly of small mammals, especially Microtus voles. These owls can detect prey under snow by sound and can plunge and  break through snow crust hard enough to support 80 kg and as deep as 45 cm.  Small mammals are swallowed whole and larger prey are pulled  apart.  Abandoned nests of other large bird such as Goshawks, Ravens, or Ospreys 10 to 50 feet above the ground are the most common nest sites, although these owls may sometimes nest on top of broken tree trunks and, rarely, on the ground; nests may be reused for several years. Typical clutch size is 2 to 5 eggs (clutch size may be larger in years with abundant food). Incubation (for 28 to 36 days) is by the female only, but the male brings food to the incubating female on nest. The female broods young for their first 2 to 3 weeks. In some areas, the adult female departs after young fledge while the male remains and feeds them for up to 3 months.

This suggests that the spinners around an island are a super-school, within which a number of sub-groups - perhaps family groups - move freely. Spinners are among the dolphins caught and killed in tuna fisheries.Links:Mammal Species of the WorldClick here for The American Society of Mammalogists species account", "sid": 129549, "picture": "http://media.eol.org/content/2010/12/04/05/01827_orig.jpg", "scientific_name": "Stenella longirostris (Gray, 1828)", "web_url": "http://www.eol.org/pages/129549", "thumb": "http://media.eol.org/content/2010/12/04/05/01827_98_68.jpg"}, "328581": {"common_name": "brown bear", "text": "Brown Bears are solitary, powerful predators who can be aggressive to one another.

The North Atlantic right whale is a baleen whale, meaning that instead of teeth, it has long plates which hang in a row (like the teeth of a comb) from its upper jaws. Baleen plates are strong and flexible; they are made of a protein similar to human fingernails.  Baleen plates are broad at the base (gumline) and taper into a fringe which forms a curtain or mat inside the whale's mouth.  Baleen whales strain huge volumes of ocean water through their baleen plates to capture food: tons of krill, other zooplankton, crustaceans, and small fish.North Atlantic Right Whales were hunted for at least 800 years, until they became so rare that it was no longer commercially viable to exploit them. Now numbering only in the hundreds, and showing no signs of recovery, Northern right whales are nearly extinct. Some populations have not shown any significant reproduction, even after becoming protected by law.Today, the North Atlantic right whale is a rarely observed species, but its name derives from an era when they were more frequently sighted, when they swam slowly, close to shore, thus making them an easy target for whalers. Not only did this swimming behaviour make this whale the right one to hunt, but this whale also floats when dead and yielded vast quantities of valuable oil and baleen.Despite its bulky size, the North Atlantic right whale is able to perform acrobatic acts such as jumping out of the water, known as breaching, violently slapping the water surface with the tail and/or  a pectoral fin. Although the purpose of these behaviours is not fully understood, they may be used in communication. Similarly, the range of low frequency groans, moans and belches that the North Atlantic right whale makes are hypothesised to be used to communicate with other individuals, or signal aggression.Remarkable for massive size, North Atlantic right whales feed chiefly on minute planktonic prey, including large copepods, the size of a grain of rice; krill, a shrimp-like crustacean; tiny planktonic snails and the drifting larval stages of barnacles and other crustaceans. North Atlantic right whales are skim feeders, meaning they consume prey by swimming forward with mouths open, allowing water to flow into the mouth and out through the baleen. Tiny prey are strained from the water as it becomes caught in the fringed baleen, where it is then dislodged by the tongue and swallowed. Although this whale often feeds at or immediately below the ocean surface, the North Atlantic right whale is also believed to sometimes feed close to the bottom, since it has been seen surfacing after a 10 to 20 minute dive with mud on its head.After feeding at northern latitudes during the summer, the North Atlantic right whale migrates south for winter. Pregnant females head for the inshore calving grounds, whilst the location of the remaining majority of the population is not known. Wherever they move, this is the season at which mating takes place.North Atlantic right whale females typically first calve at nine to ten years of age, therafter giving birth to a single young every three years. The gestation period lasts for about one year, and following birth, the mother and her young remain close until the calf is weaned at the age of one. During its first year of life the calf learns the location of critical feeding grounds from its mother, which it will continue to visit for the remainder of its life. The female then takes a third year to replenish her energy stores before breeding again.", "sid": 328579, "picture": "http://media.eol.org/content/2012/06/13/02/06356_orig.jpg", "scientific_name": "Eubalaena glacialis (M\u00fcller, 1776)", "web_url": "http://www.eol.org/pages/328579", "thumb": "http://media.eol.org/content/2012/06/13/02/06356_98_68.jpg"}, "991548": {"common_name": "Western yew", "text": "Taxaceae -- Yew family\u00a0    \u00a0    Charles L.

Also known as tideland spruce, coast spruce, and yellow spruce, this coastal species is seldom found far from tidewater, where moist maritime air and summer fogs help to maintain humid conditions necessary for growth. Throughout most of its range from northern California to Alaska, Sitka spruce is associated with western hemlock (Tsuga heterophylla) in dense stands where growth rates are among the highest in North America. It is a valuable commercial timber species for lumber, pulp, and various specialty products, and is the State Tree of Alaska.\r\n\r\nSitka spruce grows in a narrow strip along the north Pacific coast from latitude 61\u00b0 N. in southcentral Alaska to 39\u00b0 N. in northern California. The most extensive portion of the range in both width and elevation is in southeast Alaska and northern British Columbia, where the east-west range extends for about 210 km (130 mi) to include a narrow mainland strip and the many islands of the Alexander Archipelago in Alaska and the Queen Charlotte Islands in British Columbia. In Washington, the range includes a narrow mainland strip along the Strait of Georgia, around Puget Sound, up valleys to the east, and on the Olympic Peninsula. On the west side of the Olympic Peninsula, the range broadens to include the extensive coastal plain and seaward mountain slopes. It narrows southward along the Washington and Oregon coast but extends inland for several kilometers along the major rivers. In northern California, the range is more attenuated and becomes discontinuous. A disjunct population in Mendocino County, CA, marks the southern limit of the range.\r\n\r\nSitka spruce usually grows in mixed stands, less often in pure stands. Pure stands usually occur in early successional situations and as tidewater stands influenced by salt spray. Sitka spruce is commonly associated with western hemlock throughout most of its range. Toward the south, other conifer associates include Douglas-fir (Pseudotsuga menziesii), Port-Orford-cedar (Chamaecyparis lawsoniana), western white pine (Pinus monticola), and redwood (Sequoia sempervirens).\r\n\r\nSitka spruce is commercially harvested as pulpwood and for lumbers. High strength-to-weight ratio and resonant qualities of clear lumber are attributes that have traditionally made Sitka spruce wood valuable for specialty uses, such as sounding boards for high-quality pianos; guitar faces; ladders; construction components of experimental light aircraft; oars, planking, masts, and spars for custom-made or traditional boats; and turbine blades for wind energy conversion systems.\r\n", "sid": 1033696, "picture": "http://media.eol.org/content/2013/12/02/08/21957_orig.jpg", "scientific_name": "Picea sitchensis (Bong.)

Active during the day, this species spends long periods basking in the sun, either resting on its haunches or with its front limbs folded under its body like a cat.

Surprisingly, this diminutive species can reach speeds of 45 kilometres per hour over distances in excess of one kilometre. The Patagonian mara consumes a variety of vegetation, usually feeding in grass or shrubland during the day and sheltering in an abandoned burrow of another species, or amongst dense vegetation at night (2).\u00a0Perhaps the most unusual feature of this species is its social and reproductive behaviour. Patagonian maras are strictly monogamous (a rare trait in mammals), forming lifelong pairs that generally avoid contact with conspecifics, except during the curious arrangements that form in the austral summer breeding season. The female Patagonian maras dig burrows, in which the young are often reared communally (2) (3). After a gestation period of 90 days (3), the female gives birth to a litter, usually of two young, close to the entrance of a burrow (1) (2). The young, which are born well-developed, with eyes already open, quickly move into the burrow, which may be co-habited by the offspring of several other breeding pairs (2). The young remain in the vicinity of the burrow for the next four months, where they are visited daily by the mother to be suckled. When the breeding pair visits the burrow, the female makes a shrill call, which brings all the infant Patagonian maras in the burrow to the surface. The female then attempts to discern its own offspring within the group by smell, while chasing off the young of other pairs, which try to, and occasionally succeed, in obtaining the female's milk. Once identified, the female leads its offspring a short distance away from the burrow to be fed, while the adult male keeps watch, chasing off other pairs that approach. The other breeding pairs must therefore wait until the preceding pair have departed, before visiting the burrow. This communal behaviour is thought to help reduce predation, as it means that adults are more frequently present around the burrow (3).", "sid": 1038700, "picture": "http://media.eol.org/content/2014/10/26/02/53853_orig.jpg", "scientific_name": "Dolichotis patagonum", "web_url": "http://www.eol.org/pages/1038700", "thumb": "http://media.eol.org/content/2014/10/26/02/53853_98_68.jpg"}, "328653": {"common_name": "Reindeer", "text": "Caribou, or Reindeer, is the only deer species in which both males and females have candelabra-like antlers.

Getting at winter feed by digging through the snow can lead to intense competition, which may explain why females also carry antlers. During the breeding season, males compete with one another for access to females, using their antlers in jousting matches. They become completely devoted to the rituals of mating, failing even to eat, and losing their built up energy reserves in the process.

The females were also aggressive at more times of day than just feeding time, suggesting that they show dominance over all types of interactions (Digby and Kahlenberg, 2002).\r\n\r\n\tJuvenile dominance is also present in this species. A study collected data for male offspring that were born to a dominant female and a female offspring that were born to a subordinate female. The study looked at the interactions between the juveniles and other individuals in the population. They found that maternal rank determined whether the juvenile would be dominant in conflicts. Offspring born to the dominant female had a dominant adult to help them in altercations, which made them dominant over others. They reached this conclusion because the juvenile female born to the subordinate mother was more submissive to other individuals in the group compared to the juvenile males with dominant mothers (Archie and Digby, 1999).\r\n\r\n\tBehavior between groups is interesting for this species. Each group is composed of about 8 individuals, sometimes a few more or a few less (Randriatahina and Roeder, 2013 & Volampeno et al., 2010). These populations are very stable, with no more than 3 adult females and 2-5 males in one group at a time. Encounters between groups occur at feeding and resting sites, with each group remaining intact, without switching or wandering into another group. Females act antagonistically toward other groups, exerting their dominance (Randriatahina and Roeder, 2013). More research needs to be done in this area to determine if the females limit populations of lemurs from feeding and migrating. If some populations or individuals are not thriving because of females, then management of the populations could include food distribution to see that all individuals are able to eat.\u00a0\r\n\r\n\tE. flavifrons was included in a study of cognitive ability and the similarity between 3 lemur species, old world monkeys, and humans. The study showed that there is conservation among the primate order of the approximate number system, which was used to indicate cognitive ability. The study mentioned that lemurs do not demonstrate deception, or advanced visual communication, or coalition within groups. However, lemurs are capable of transitive learning (understanding that if A>B and B>C, then A<C; Bryson and Leong, 2007), object displacement, and learning contingency (stimulus-based, associative behaviors similar to Pavlovian conditioning; Penn and Povinelli, 2007) when participating in a food-rewarding task (Jones et al., 2012). This study relates to their small group size and feeding habits, indicating that they understand the numerical availability of food (Randriatahina and Roeder, 2013 & Volampeno et al., 2010).\r\n", "sid": 326527, "picture": "http://media.eol.org/content/2014/05/07/15/10299_orig.jpg", "scientific_name": "Eulemur macaco", "web_url": "http://www.eol.org/pages/326527", "thumb": "http://media.eol.org/content/2014/05/07/15/10299_98_68.jpg"}, "1048664": {"common_name": "Grey Heron", "text": "Grey herons feed on a wide range of prey items but are primarily piscivores.

Although fully capable of excavating its own burrow, the burrowing owl most commonly occupies the abandoned burrows of mammals (2). In the northern part of its range it commonly uses the burrows of prairie dogs, while in South America, as noted by the famous naturalist Charles Darwin, it inhabits burrows made by large, rabbit-like rodents called viscachas (6). Interestingly, burrowing owls purposefully deposit piles of mammal dung around the entrance of their burrows. This unusual behaviour has been shown to be a method of baiting, as the dung attracts numerous dung beetles, which the owl then feeds upon (7). Aside from invertebrates, the burrowing owl will also take small mammals, birds and reptiles, either pursing its prey on foot or diving down upon it from the air or a perch (2). Outside the breeding season, this species rests in its burrow during the day and mainly hunts at dusk, during the night, and at dawn. During breeding, however, burrowing owls may forage at any point during the day or night (2) (4).\u00a0During the spring breeding season, burrowing owls form monogamous pairs, which maintain a small territory comprising the nesting burrow and the immediate surroundings. The female lays a clutch of up to 11 eggs, which are incubated for around one month, while the male brings food. In the initial period after hatching, the female remains with the young and is supported by the male, but as the young become more developed the female leaves the burrow and assists the male in foraging for food. After around 44 days the young leave the burrow and join the parent birds on hunting flights (2).\u00a0While many burrowing owl breeding pairs remain resident around a burrow throughout the year, individuals from Canada and the northern USA are migratory. At the end of the breeding season, pairs in these regions split up and fly south to overwinter, before returning in the following spring and establishing a new breeding pair with a different partner (2).", "sid": 1045997, "picture": "http://media.eol.org/content/2013/02/14/14/49023_orig.jpg", "scientific_name": "Athene cunicularia (Molina, 1782)", "web_url": "http://www.eol.org/pages/1045997", "thumb": "http://media.eol.org/content/2013/02/14/14/49023_98_68.jpg"}, "223824": {"common_name": "Glauert's sea-dragon", "text": "Seadragons are seen either solitarily or in pairs, they are slow-moving and rely on their elegant camouflage to provide protection from predators (2).

Age determination is difficult in this species but males are believed to mature at 11 to 14 years, females at 18 to 35 years, and longevity to reach 80 years for both sexes (3).\u00a0The bluntnose six-gill shark is a skilled predator and may also scavenge, feeding nocturnally on a wide variety of marine organisms including other sharks, rays, bony fishes, squid, crabs, and seals (1) (2).

White-throated Sparrows breed mainly in Canada, with some additional breeding populations in the northernmost portions of the Great Lakes states and in parts of the northeastern United States. They winter along the Pacific coast of the United States (but are relatively rare here) and in approximately the southeastern half of the United States from New Mexico to Kansas, Ohio, and New Hampshire.\r\n\r\nThis common and widespread sparrow is named for its conspicuously and strongly outlined white throat. It has rusty brown upperparts, a dark bill, dark crown stripes, and a dark eyeline. The broad \"eyebrow\" (above the eye) is yellow in front of the eye, with the remainder either tan or white (two distinct color morphs). Juveniles have a grayish eyebrow and throat with heavily streaked breast and sides. \r\n\r\nThe song, which is often heard even in winter, is a thin pensive whistle, generally two single notes followed by three triple notes: \"Oh sweet Canada Canada Canada\" (or \"Old Sam Peabody, Peabody, Peabody\"). The sharp tink and lisping tseep calls are frequently heard from flocks of sparrows in thickets.\r\n\r\nWhite-throated Sparrows eat mainly seeds and insects. Insects make up a large part of the diet during the breeding season (and young are fed mainly on insects), but the winter diet consists mainly of \"weed\" and grass seeds. Especially in fall, many berries may be consumed. White-throated Sparrows forage mainly on the ground under or close to dense thickets, scratching in the leaf litter with both feet. \r\n\r\nWhite-throated Sparrows almost always nest on the ground, at a site well hidden by low shrubs, grass, or ferns. They may occasionally nest above ground up to a height of several meters. The nest (built by the female) is an open cup made of grass, twigs, weeds, and pine needles and lined with fine grass, rootlets, and animal hair. The 4 to 5 eggs (sometimes  3 or 6, rarely 2 or 7) are pale blue or greenish blue and marked with reddish brown and lavender. Eggs are incubated (by the female only) for around 11 to 14 days. Both parents feed the nestlings. Young typically leave the nest 8 to 9 days after hatching, but are tended by the parents for at least another 2 weeks. \r\n\r\nResearchers have identified behavioral differences associated with the white-striped versus tan-striped morphs. Both males and females may exhibit either color, but adults nearly always mate with the opposite color morph. White-striped males tend to be more aggressive and to sing more than tan-striped males. White-striped females also sing, but tan-striped females generally do not. Pairs involving a tan-striped male and white-striped female usually form more quickly than the opposite combination. Tan-striped adults tend to feed their young more than white-striped adults.\r\n\r\nMigration occurs mostly at night. White-throated Sparrows tend to migrate relatively late in the fall, gradually moving south to their wintering grounds. \r\n\r\n(Kaufman 1996; AOU 1998; Dunn and Alderfer 2011)\r\n", "sid": 922651, "picture": "http://media.eol.org/content/2014/04/16/10/82922_orig.jpg", "scientific_name": "Zonotrichia albicollis", "web_url": "http://www.eol.org/pages/922651", "thumb": "http://media.eol.org/content/2014/04/16/10/82922_98_68.jpg"}, "790439": {"common_name": "common slider", "text": "This taxon is found in the Panamanian dry forests, but not necessarily limited to this ecoregion.

There are two subspecies recognized in North America that are primarily distinguished by range: C. s. serpentina(the common snapping turtle, which is the largest subspecies, primarily occupies the United States east of the Rockies, except for the southern portions of Texas and Florida), and C. s. osceola (the Florida snapping turtle, found in the Florida peninsula) (Conant and Collins, 1991). In this profile, studies refer to the serpentine subspecies unless otherwise noted.\r\n\r\nAdult snapping turtles are large, 20 to 37 cm in carapace length, and males attain larger sizes than females (Congdon et al., 1986; Ernst and Barbour, 1972; Galbraith et al., 1988). In a large oligotrophic lake in Ontario Canada, adult males averaged over 10 kg, whereas the females averaged 5.2 kg (Galbraith et al., 1988). In other populations, the difference in size between males and females often is less (Congdon et al., 1986; Galbraith et al., 1988; Hammer, 1969). They reach sexual maturity at approximately 200 mm in carapace length (Mosimann and Bider, 1960). The cool, short activity season in more northern areas results in slower growth rates and longer times to reach sexual maturity (Bury, 1979).\r\n\r\nThey are most often found in turbid waters with a slow current (Graves and Anderson, 1987). They spend most of their time lying on the bottom of deep pools or buried in the mud in shallow water with only their eyes and nostrils exposed. Froese (1978) observed that young snapping turtles show a preference for areas with some obstructions that may provide cover or food.\r\n\r\nSnapping turtles are omnivorous. In early spring, when limited aquatic vegetation exists in lakes and ponds, they may eat primarily animal matter; however, when aquatic vegetation becomes abundant, they become more herbivorous (Pell, 1941, cited in Graves and Anderson, 1987). Young snapping turtles are primarily carnivorous and prefer smaller streams where aquatic vegetation is less abundant (Lagler, 1943; Pell, 1941, cited in Graves and Anderson, 1987). Snapping turtles consume a wide variety of animal material including insects, crustaceans, clams, snails, earthworms, leeches, tubificid worms, freshwater sponges, fish (adults, fry, and eggs), frogs and toads, salamanders, snakes, small turtles, birds, small mammals, and carrion and plant material including various algae (Alexander, 1943; Graves and Anderson, 1987; Hammer, 1969; \ufffcPunzo, 1975). \r\n\r\nSnappers are most active at night. During the day, they occasionally leave the water to bask on shore, but basking is probably restricted by intolerance to high temperatures and by rapid loss of moisture (Ernst and Barbour, 1972).\r\n\r\nSnapping turtles usually enter hibernation by late October and emerge sometime between March and May, depending on latitude and temperature. To hibernate, they burrow into the debris or mud bottom of ponds or lakes, settle beneath logs, or retreat into muskrat burrows or lodges. Snapping turtles have been seen moving on or below the ice in midwinter. Large congregations sometimes hibernate together (Budhabatti and Moll, 1988; Ernst and Barbour, 1972).\r\n\r\nMost turtles stay primarily within the same marsh or in one general area from year to year ((Hammer, 1969; Obbard and Brooks, 1981).

Norway spruce has escaped cultivation and naturalized throughout the northeastern U.S. and Canada, from Maine to Minnesota, from northern Quebec to southern Virginia and North Carolina, as well as in the Rocky Mountain and Pacific Northwest states. \r\n\r\nNorway spruce grows to 35-55 m (115-180 ft) tall and with a trunk diameter of up to 1-1.5 m; it is fast-growing when young, and can grow up to 1 meter per year for 25 years.

They are found in ponds only in the breeding season; during the rest of the year they can be found far from water bodies (5). They have a broad diet, feeding on a huge range of prey small enough to swallow, including insects, spiders, earwigs, earthworms, snails and slugs; they have even been observed eating young toads (2). They feed only on land and use a 'sit-and-wait' style of hunting (6). Toads are usually welcomed by gardeners, thanks to their voracious appetites and penchant for garden pests (4).\u00a0The life cycle is similar to that of the common frog (Rana temporaria). Common toads begin to migrate to breeding ponds in autumn. The onset of cold weather stimulates hibernation, which takes place en route in abandoned rodent burrows or in leaf litter (2). Migration then recommences in spring.\u00a0Breeding activity, which occurs between March and June (6), is often very frenzied in this species, with much competition amongst males over access to females. Males grasp females tightly prior to spawning, and there is aggressive activity amongst males who try to 'take-over' females. 'Mating-balls' may often arise, when as many as 10 males jostle for access to a single female; the female occasionally drowns or is crushed as a result (2). Successful pairs will spawn; females release a double-string of eggs, which the male fertilises by releasing his sperm simultaneously. The pair moves around whilst spawning, so that the jelly-coated strings of eggs become wrapped around vegetation. One female may produce up to 5,000 eggs, although the usual number is around 1,500 (2). The black tadpoles move away from the spawning areas a few days after hatching. The tadpoles feed on microorganisms and usually gather in groups, which, in addition to the presence of skin toxins, probably protects them further against predation. Despite this, however, they frequently become prey for diving beetles and other species that have piercing mouthparts, and so can avoid the toxins in the skin (2). It takes 8-12 weeks for tadpoles to develop, after metamorphosis the tiny toadlets occasionally emerge en masse. Sexual maturity is reached after 2-3 years (2). Common toads can live for a very long time; some captive individuals have reached 50 years of age (5).", "sid": 333310, "picture": "http://media.eol.org/content/2013/04/13/12/13061_orig.jpg", "scientific_name": "Bufo bufo (Linnaeus, 1758)", "web_url": "http://www.eol.org/pages/333310", "thumb": "http://media.eol.org/content/2013/04/13/12/13061_98_68.jpg"}, "308531": {"common_name": "Blue Wildebeest", "text": "The blue wildebeest is a grazer, its broad mouth adapted to bulk feeding on short grass. However, its dependence on short grass, together with its need to drink at least every other day, limits the species to moist grassland and to areas within reach of water (4) (8), although interestingly it is also known to survive in waterless regions of the Kalahari by feeding on melons and water-storing roots and tubers (4). The need to follow seasonal grazing and water supplies leads the blue wildebeest to form some of the largest migratory herds of all antelopes, with those in the Serengeti-Masai Mara ecosystem of Kenya and Tanzania forming part of the world's largest remaining aggregations of large land mammals (4). However, not all wildebeest migrate, with some remaining in the same area year-round, generally forming small herds of up to ten females plus immature offspring (2) (4). The females in these herds tend to establish dominance hierarchies and harass any outsiders who attempt to join. In contrast, the only stable associations in migratory herds are between a female and offspring. Depending on the environmental conditions, different blue wildebeest populations, and even the same population at different times, may show every variation between these social extremes (4).\u00a0The blue wildebeest has an unusually restricted breeding season. Around 80 to 90 percent of calves are born within a two to three week period, usually at the start of the rains, when conditions are most favourable (2) (4). This also helps to protect the calves by creating a glut for predators. The female blue wildebeest gives birth annually, to a single calf, after a gestation period of around eight months. The calf follows the female from the moment it can stand, usually within 15 minutes of birth, and is weaned by nine months (2). The young male is pushed out of the herd by territorial males after the first year, after which it joins a bachelor herd, which may also contain older and non-territorial males (2) (4). After reaching sexual maturity at three to four years old, the male becomes solitary and attempts to establish its own territory, which may be temporary in migratory populations, or may be continuously occupied and defended for years (2). Territorial competition between males typically involves ritualised displays, pushing with the horns, and the loud 'ge-nu' call that gives the wildebeest its other name, the gnu (2) (6).

In the New World, Barn Swallows breed from Canada to Mexico. They are also now established as breeders in northeastern Argentina, where a small number of breeding pairs were first documented in 1980 and the species has since been well established (Billerman et al. 2011). They winter from Mexico and Panama, Puerto Rico, and the Lesser Antilles south throughout South America to Tierra del Fuego. In Eurasia, the breeding range extends from Iceland, the British Isles, the Faeroe Islands, Scandinavia, northern Russia, and northern Siberia south to the Mediterranean region, northern Africa, the Near East, Arabia, Iran, the Himalayas, China, Taiwan, and Japan;  these Old World populations winter south to tropical Africa, the East Indies, northern Australia, and Micronesia. Winter range can be difficult to delineate due to late fall records (as late as December) and early spring migrants. \r\n\r\nBarn Swallows live in open or semi-open country (farms, fields, marshes, lakes), often near water, and capture and eat most of their food (mainly flying insects) in the air. \r\n\r\nCourtship involves aerial chases. On a perch, the members of a mated pair sit close together, touch bills, and engage in mutual preening. Several Barn Swallow pairs may nest in the same immediate area, but Barn Swallows do not form dense colonies as some swallows do. Originally, Barn Swallows nested in crevices in cliffs or shallow caves, but today most nest sites are in open buildings, under eaves, under bridges or docks, or in similar situations. The nest, which is built by both sexes, is a cup of mud and dried grass lined with feathers. The 4 to 5 (sometimes 6, rarely 7) eggs are white, spotted with brown. Eggs are incubated by both sexes (but especially by the female) for 13 to 17 days. Both parents feed the young. One or two additional birds, the pair's offspring from previous broods, may attend the nest and sometimes feed the nestlings. Young leave the nest around 18 to 23 days after hatching. \r\n\r\nBarn Swallows migrate in flocks, mainly by day. \r\n\r\n(Kaufman 1996; AOU 1998; Dunn and Alderfer 2011)\r\n\r\n", "sid": 917688, "picture": "http://media.eol.org/content/2012/06/13/13/78901_orig.jpg", "scientific_name": "Hirundo rustica", "web_url": "http://www.eol.org/pages/917688", "thumb": "http://media.eol.org/content/2012/06/13/13/78901_98_68.jpg"}, "327553": {"common_name": "big brown bat", "text": "Big brown bats make their homes in rural areas, towns, and cities, sometimes choosing barns, houses, or other buildings as roosts.

Females in the eastern United States usually give birth to twins; those in the West usually have a single pup each year. Females may return to the same colony year after year. On warm, dry evenings, the bats leave the roost shortly after sunset to forage for insects especially flying beetles which they catch and eat in the air.

This is a common bird of woodlands, farmland, and suburbs across most of  North America, breeding from British Columbia and southern Quebec in Canada south to southern Mexico, with a southward contraction of this range in the winter. \r\n\r\nBrown-headed Cowbirds are well known as \"brood parasites\", sneaking their eggs into the nests of birds of other species to be reared by adoptive \"host\" parents (which are often much smaller than them). During the breeding season, Brown-headed Cowbirds tend to engage in courtship and nest parasitism mainly in the morning and to feed in the afternoon. A single female may travel more than 6 km through woodlands to lay as many as several dozen eggs in a breeding season. Providing bird food in spring around the edges of large woodlands unintentionally facilitates brood parasitism by cowbirds, which can greatly reproduce the reproductive output of their hosts. \r\n\r\nIn the breeding season, males display by fluffing up their body feathers, partly speading their wings and tail, and bowing deeply while singing. Groups of males sometimes perch together, singing and displaying. The male's song is a squeaky gurgle. \r\n\r\nBrown-headed Cowbird eggs are whitish with brown and gray spots concentrated at the larger end and are often easily recognized because they look different and larger than the other eggs in a host nest. A female may lay nearly an egg per day for several weeks, up to 40 in a breeding season (rarely as many as 70 or more). A female will often remove a host egg before adding one of her own.  Brown-headed Cowbird eggs have been found in the nests of more than 220 species and over 140 of these are known to have successfully reared young cowbirds. Fed by their host parents, cowbird nestlings develop rapidly, usually leaving the nest after  about 10 or 11 days.\r\n\r\nThe diet of the Brown-headed Cowbird consists mainly of seeds and insects (seeds account for around half the diet during the breeding season, but more than 90% in the winter). Centuries ago, these birds probably followed bison herds on the Great Plains,  as they often follow cattle and horses across North America today, feeding on insects flushed from the grass. This dramatic range expansion over the past century or two has negatively impacted a number of parasatized songbird species, some quite seriously.\r\n\r\n(Kaufman 1996; AOU 1998; Dunn and Alderfer 2011)\r\n", "sid": 1052060, "picture": "http://media.eol.org/content/2013/02/01/16/43842_orig.jpg", "scientific_name": "Molothrus ater", "web_url": "http://www.eol.org/pages/1052060", "thumb": "http://media.eol.org/content/2013/02/01/16/43842_98_68.jpg"}, "327960": {"common_name": "rhesus macaque", "text": "This adaptable species is highly promiscuous and both males and females mate with as many members of the opposite sex as possible. They travel in groups of between 8 and 180 individuals, usually with two to four times as many females as males. Breeding takes place whenever the seasons permit, with no defined period in non-seasonal areas. Females undergo a regular oestrus cycle of 26 \u2013 29 days, but unlike many other macaques, the genital region swells and darkens in colour only slightly during the fertile period, and only in younger adult females (4). Gestation lasts around 165 days, and females give birth to a single young or, rarely, twins. The young is fed milk for a year, first clinging to the mother's belly, but riding on her back when older. After weaning, female juveniles may remain with the same group whereas males often disperse to another. Females become sexually mature between 2.5 and 4 years and males between 4.5 and 7 years. Females who reach ages of more than 25 years go through the menopause, eventually becoming infertile (6).\u00a0The rhesus macaque shows dominance hierarchies in both sexes, but more so in males. The status of each individual is inherited from its mother. There may be confrontations between groups, but these are rare as weaker groups actively avoid stronger groups. Females within groups can be very loud, but rarely fight as they are usually closely related (4). All members of the group practise social grooming for pleasure, health and as a form of submission and appeasement. Appeasement is also shown by the fear grimace in which the lips are retracted to reveal the clenched teeth. Staring with the mouth open signifies threat and putting the tail vertically upwards indicates aggressive confidence. Infants attract their mother's attention by cooing, and adult females will also coo to attract a male. Males respond by lip-smacking as an invitation to mate (5).\u00a0The diet of the rhesus macaque varies by region. They are omnivorous opportunists, feeding mainly on roots, herbs, insects, crop plants and small animals.

During this time the males and females shed feathers from the breast, leaving a naked patch that is thought to help transfer heat to the egg during incubation.

It is the only species of squirrel monkey occurring outside South America [5]. Some people think squirrel monkeys lived in Colombia in the late Miocene or Pliocene and migrated to Central America, becoming the ancestors of the red-backed species. Passage through the isthmus of Panama later closed due to rising oceans, and eventually opened up to another wave of migration @ 2 million years ago, when ancestors of modern populations of monkeys out-competed the earlier migrants, leading to the small range of the red-backed squirrel monkey [19]. The red-backed species was thought to be a a population of a South American species of squirrel monkey brought to Central America by humans. Evidence included the very small range of the red-backed species and the large gap from the range of other species. Nuclear and mitochondrial DNA showed tht the red-backed squirrel monkey is a separate species that apparently diverged from the South American species 260,000 to over 4 million years ago.[3]\r\nThe squirrel lives mainly in lowland scrub forest, but also inhabits humid tropical forest, mature upland forest, river edge and mangrove forest (22).

In general, squirrel monkeys are arboreal and can be found in primary and secondary forests (38), thickets, and mangrove swamps (52). They are also found in cultivated areas, usually around streams (38). Saimiri oerstedii is known to inhabit humid Pacific slope forests (28).\r\nThis small monkey has a slender body. Adults are 225-295 mm long, excluding the 362-465 mm tail, and weigh 500-1,100 g [5,8,28,39]; males weigh @ 750-950 g and females 600-800 g (5). The tail is not fully prehensile, but aids balance as the monkey leaps between branches like a squirrel [10,11]. The limbs are long and slender and the thighs are shorter in relation to the lower leg than in monkeys that clamber. This adaptation lets squirrel monkeys exert more force when jumping, so they can propel themselves further (24). The fur is short, thick and yellow brown, with the underside being white or pale yellow and with red, golden-red or orange fur on the back (25,28,40), olive shoulders, hips and tail, a black cap on top of the head [39], a white face with black rims around the eyes and black around the nose and mouth [7,8], orange hands and feet and a black tail tip. Males and females are similar, but males are 16% larger and generally have lighter caps than females [5]. In the breeding season males become 'fatted', becoming larger around the neck and shoulders (24). Squirrel monkeys have the largest brains of all primates relative to body size; the red-backed squirrel monkey's brain weighs about 25.7 g or @ 4% of its body weight [7,9]. \r\nThe monkey is active by day and is arboreal (26). It usually walks and runs through the trees on all fours [7]. It lives in groups of 20-75 with several adult males, adult females and juveniles [5,12,43,46,47]. Groups above 100 are thought to be temporary mergers of two groups [2]. On average, groups contain about 60% more females than males [5]. The monkey has an egalitarian social structure; neither males nor females are dominant over each other [5]. Females do not form dominance hierarchies or coalitions [2,5]. There is no evidence of coalition formation in social interactions. Males in a group tend to be related to each other, so tend to form strong affiliations, only forming dominance hierarchies in the breeding season [5,15]. This is especially the case among males of the same age [12]. Groups have a home range of 35-63 hectares [12], which can overlap, especially in large, protected areas rather than more fragmented areas[12]. Groups can travel 2.5-4.2 km a day [13,26,29]. They do not split into separate foraging groups during the day. Individuals may separate from the main group to engage in different activities for periods of time, so the group may be dispersed over an area of up 1.2 hectares at any given time [14]. The group tends to sleep in the same trees every night for months at a time [14]. Groups generally do not compete or fight with each other [2]. The monkey is noisy. It makes many squeals, whistles and chirps[8]. It travels through the forest noisily, while disturbing vegetation [8]. It has four main calls: a \"smooth chuck\", \"bent mask chuck\", \"peep\" and \"twitter\".[7]\r\nThere is little competition or agonistic interactions between groups. The squirrel monkey rarely associates with the white-headed capuchin. Its food occurs in smaller, more dispersed patches than with South American species, so associating with capuchins would impose higher foraging costs. While male white-headed capuchins are alert to predators, they devote more attention to detecting rival males than to detecting predators, and relatively less time to detecting predators than their South American counterparts. Associating with capuchins provides less predator detection benefits and imposes higher foraging costs on the red-backed squirrel monkey than on South American species [5,11,16,17]. Some bird species associate with the red-backed squirrel monkey. They follow monkeys to try and prey on insects and small vertebrates that the monkeys flush out, especially in the wet season, when arthropods are harder to find [12].\r\nThe monkey is omnivorous and spends most of the morning and afternoon foraging through the lower and middle levels of the forest (mainly the lower canopy and understory), typically at 4.5-9 m high.[12,14], but may travel at other levels. It eats berries and other fruits, nuts, seeds, leaves, buds, flower nectar, gums and other plant materials, invertebrates (especially grasshoppers and caterpillars) and small vertebrates [4,27,28,38,41,43,44]. Nearly half of the diet is made up of fruit [4]. It has difficulty finding its desired food late in the wet season, when fewer arthropods are available [8]. It is said to recognise the folded leaf-tents made by some fruit-eating bats, attacking them to extract roosting bats (28). When it finds a bat it climbs to a higher level and jumps onto the tent from above, trying to dislodge the bat. If the fallen bat doesn't fly away in time, the monkey pounces on it on the ground and eats it [12]. The fruits the monkey typically exploits occur in small and very scarce patches; feeding competition is very low. In the dry season shortages of appropriate fruiting trees means it may depend entirely on animal prey (45). The monkey is an important seed disperser and a pollinator of passion flowers and other flowers [12]. It is not a significant agricultural pest, but may eat corn, coffee, bananas, mangos and other fruits[12,14]. When monkeys find food in a tree, they often do not completely use up the resources available and may return to it later (6).\r\nPredators include birds of prey, cats and constricting and venomous snakes [5]. The oldest males show high levels of vigilance for predators and bear most responsibility for detecting them [2,12]. When a monkey detects a raptor, it gives a high-pitched alarm peep and dives for cover, as do other monkeys that hear the alarm call. The monkeys are very cautious about raptors and give alarms when they detect any raptor-like object, including small airplanes, falling branches and large leaves [14]. Raptors spend much more time near monkey troops when infants are born and prey on many of the newborn infants. Other predators include toucans, tayras, opossums, coatis and spider monkeys [14]. \r\nReproduction is seasonal, seldom exceeding two months in duration in the dry season (51). Mating occurs in September [12] or January and February. All females enter oestrus at about the same time. A month or two before the breeding season begins, males become larger, due to altered water balance within the body. This is caused by converting the male hormone testosterone into oestrogen; the more testosterone he produces, the more he grows before the breeding season. Reproductively mature males collaborate in mobbing females in the mating season. As males in a group have not been seen fighting over access to females in the breeding season, nor trying to force females to copulate with them, it is thought that female choice determines which males get to breed with females. Females tend to prefer males that expand the most in advance of breeding season. This may be because the most enlarged males are generally the oldest and most effective at detecting predators or it may be due to runaway intersexual selection [14]. Males may leave their group for short periods of time in the breeding season to try to mate with females from neighboring groups. Females are receptive to males from other groups, but resident males try to repel intruders. \r\nMating usually occurs during the dry season. In S. oerstedii, sexual receptivity in females is synchronized, lasting perhaps 12-36 hours a season [50]. \r\nSingle births occur after 6-7 months at night and during wet season, the period of greatest food availability, within a single week in February and March [5,6,12,14,28], so there is enough food for mothers and their young and less time is spent foraging (30). The infant has a fully prehensile tail [10,11]. It depends on its mother for about one year [12]. The mother takes care of the young, which rides on her back and nurses, with little attention paid to it by the group members (6), but other females ('aunts') may help (6). During its third and fourth weeks of life, the infant begins to move around more and between weeks five and ten, it occasionally disembarks from its mother's back, explores the nearby area, and starts to eat solid foods (6). Over the next few months, contacts with the mother become less frequent (6). Social play probably first occurs @ 2 months (6) and helps separate the infant from its mother (52). In the first year of life, the young monkeys engage in social play with each other, usually in the form of fighting games (6). \r\nFemales give birth every 12 months [48,53], so the prior infant becomes independent at about the same time the new infant is born. Only 50% of infants survive over 6 months, largely due to predation by birds [5]. Females do not resume cycling until their infant either dies or is weaned (4). Females become adult at 12-13 months and sexually mature at 1-2.5 years old; males become sexually mature at 4-6 years old [5,6]. Females leave their natal group on reaching sexual maturity;  males usually stay with their group for their entire lives [5]. Males of the same age tend to associate with each other in age cohorts. On reaching sexual maturity, an age cohort may choose to leave the group and try to oust the males from another group to attain increased reproductive opportunities [5]. Captive can live over 15-18 years [12,55]; other species may live over 20 years.[5]\r\nThe monkey was classified as Endangered on the IUCN Red List 2003 (2,22,38) and is listed on Appendix I of CITES (23). The population declined steeply after the 1970s, probably due to deforestation for agriculture and logging, hunting and capture to be kept as pets; its fragmented range encompasses 8,000 square km [18,38]. In 2008 the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) upgraded its conservation status from \"endangered\" to \"vulnerable\"; it is abundant in the areas it inhabits [4]. Its survival is entwined with the future of the forests (22).  A survey in 2003 showed that the total population size (1300-1780) is significantly larger than previous estimates (26,28). The population density is estimated at 36 monkeys per square kilometre in Costa Rica and 130 in Panama.[13] It has been estimated that the population of the Central American squirrel monkey has been reduced from about 200,000 in the 1970s to less than 5000 [18].  There are significant efforts within Costa Rica to try to preserve this monkey from extinction.[20] A reforestation project within Panama tries to preserve the vanishing population of the Chiriqui Province.[21]\r\nThere are two subspecies [1]. The black-crowned Central American squirrel monkey (Saimiri oerstedii oerstedii) lives in the Chiriqui and Veraguas provinces, on the Pacific coast of northwest Panama and the coast of the Puntarenas province and Osa Peninsula area of south-west Costa Rica (including Corcovado National Park) (28,29,31-34). It lives at 0-500 m above sea level (31). It has a black crown and more yellowish limbs and underparts [3]. In Panama, it has suffered habitat losses of 76% and now occurs in fragmented forest areas throughout its range (1,166km\u00b2) (22). It is Endangered.\r\nThe grey-crowned Central American squirrel monkey (Saimiri oerstedii citrinellus) lives in the Quepos forests in the Central Pacific portion of south-west Costa Rica [22,26,35], up to 500 m above sea level. In 2003, the remaining wild population was estimated to be 1300-1800 individuals [2] in a restricted, severely fragmented range of 210 km\u00b2 [22,36,37]. The male has an agouti crown; the crown is blackish-grey in the female (24). It is Critically Endangered and has lost 89% of its original habitat, due to widespread logging and clearing for cattle ranches which started during the 1950s. Large areas were planted with African oil palms and rice. The largest single population occurs in the Manuel Antonio National Park in Panama (22). The total number is up to 1300-1800 individuals (26,32,37).\r\n", "sid": 323911, "picture": "http://media.eol.org/content/2013/05/20/10/68642_orig.jpg", "scientific_name": "Saimiri oerstedii", "web_url": "http://www.eol.org/pages/323911", "thumb": "http://media.eol.org/content/2013/05/20/10/68642_98_68.jpg"}, "328692": {"common_name": "Alpine Ibex", "text": "", "sid": 328692, "picture": "http://media.eol.org/content/2014/04/16/10/97448_orig.jpg", "scientific_name": "Capra ibex", "web_url": "http://www.eol.org/pages/328692", "thumb": "http://media.eol.org/content/2014/04/16/10/97448_98_68.jpg"}, "311501": {"common_name": "Black Rhinoceros", "text": "The black rhinoceros or hook-lipped rhinoceros (Diceros bicornis) is a species of rhinoceros, native to eastern and central Africa including Kenya, Tanzania, Cameroon, South Africa, Namibia, Zimbabwe, and Angola.

They live in stable communities that may have up to 150 members, although these will usually split into smaller groups in order to forage or travel (2).

A single offspring is born after around 8 months of gestation and will be cared for by its mother for almost 5 years (6). Bonobo society has some very marked differences to those of chimpanzees and this has fascinated researchers since their discovery. In both, males remain in their natal group whilst females disperse, but in contrast to the male-dominated chimpanzee society, females in bonobo groups develop strong relationships and males will often defer to them during feeding (2). The cooperative hunting and aggressive raids on neighbouring groups that male chimpanzees partake in have not been seen amongst bonobos and it may be that these differences are related to a more reliable and widely available food source (2). One of the other striking features of bonobo society is sex, which is commonly used for social communication in order to diffuse situations and create bonds (2). Males and females engage in these encounters with their own sex as well as the opposite sex (2).\u00a0Bonobos spend virtually all of their time in the trees, foraging for fruit and sleeping in nests constructed in the branches; on the ground they travel by 'knuckle walking' (2).

They have also been introduced and established in the Hawaiian Islands (main islands from Kauai eastward) and in Bermuda. Northern Mockingbirds are found in a variety of open and semi-open situations, especially in scrub, thickets, and gardens and in towns and cities and around cultivated areas.\r\n \r\nNorthern Mockingbirds sing a mix of original and imitative phrases, each repeated several times. They may imitate the songs of a wide variety of other birds' songs and calls, sometimes in rapid succession, as well as other sounds. They often sing at night as well as during the day. Both sexes sing in fall as they claim feeding territories. The often heard call is a loud, sharp check.\r\n\r\nThe diet of the Northern Mockingbird consists mostly of insects and berries. The annual diet is around half insects and other arthropods and half berries and other fruits, but the diet is heavy on insects in late spring and summer and in fruits in fall and winter. \r\n\r\nNesting begins early in the year, by late winter in the southern United States. The male sings to defend his territory and attract a mate, often leaping a meter in the air and flapping his wings while singing. Early courtship involves the male and female chasing each other around the male's territory. The nest is placed in a dense tree or shrub, typically one to three meters above the ground, but sometimes lower or higher (rarely up to 18 m). The nest has a bulky foundation of twigs supporting an open cup of weeds, grass, and leaves lined with fine material such as rootlets, moss, animal hair, and plant down. The male builds most of the foundation and the female adds most of the lining. Typical clutch size is 3 to 4 eggs (sometimes as few as 2 or as many as 6). Egg color ranges from greenish to bluish gray, with blotches of brown usually concentrated at the larger end. Eggs are incubated (by the female alone) for 12 to 13 days. Both parents feed the nestlings, which leave the nest around 12 days after hatching but are not able to fly well for another week or so. Northern Mockingbirds may produce two to three clutches per year.\r\n \r\nNorthern Mockingbirds were often captured for sale as pets from the late 1700s to the early 1900s and possibly as a result became scarce along much of the northern edge of their range. With the end of the cagebird trade, the Northern Mockingbird became more common in many areas. In recent decades, this species has expanded its range northward, especially in the northeast, possibly as a consequence of the widespread planting of multiflora rose (an excellent source of both food and nesting sites) and a changing climate.\r\n\r\n(Kaufman 1996; AOU 1998; Dunn and Alderfer 2011)\r\n", "sid": 1050704, "picture": "http://media.eol.org/content/2015/06/04/10/09730_orig.jpg", "scientific_name": "Mimus polyglottos", "web_url": "http://www.eol.org/pages/1050704", "thumb": "http://media.eol.org/content/2015/06/04/10/09730_98_68.jpg"}, "796029": {"common_name": "American alligator", "text": "Crocodilia, originating more than 200 million years ago in the late Triassic Period natives to the super continent Pangea.

Wings are chestnut with conspicuous, contrasting, pale patches. The head is slightly crested, the bill is thin and yellow, and the iris is yellow. (Gibbs et al. 1992). Bitterns have a laterally compressed trunk, short legs, short outer toes, and long, curved toenails that enable them to travel through and grasp the dense, emergent vegetation (NatureServe 2001).

They possess acute eyesight, with which they can locate prey, and their flesh consists primarily of 'white' muscle which provides energy for sudden bursts of activity, such as when in pursuit of their quarry (3).  The swordfish then uses its bill to stun or impale its victim, slashes it into pieces or swallows it whole (3) (5).  Swordfish feed during the day (3), primarily on squid, but also fish and occasionally crustaceans (6) (7) (8).  They undertake vertical migrations in the ocean, following the movement of many small shrimp, fish and squid that move with the changing light intensity in a (somewhat unsuccessful) attempt to avoid predators (3) (7).  Unlike some fish, swordfish are unable to maintain a body temperature higher than the temperature of the surrounding water.  Instead, they have a unique muscle and brown tissue that warms blood flowing to the brain and eyes, enabling it to tolerate the extreme cold of the ocean depths (3).\u00a0Swordfish also undertake lengthy seasonal migrations, to temperate or cold waters in the summer where they feed, and back to warm waters in autumn for spawning (2).  Unlike tuna, which have mostly 'red' muscle which is good for endurance activities, the mostly 'white' muscle of swordfish is not suited to swimming for long periods without fatigue (3).  Therefore, swordfish undertake their long migrations by moving with prevailing currents (3).\u00a0Spawning occurs year-round in warm equatorial waters, while in cooler regions it occurs in the spring and summer (2) (4).  The best known spawning grounds of the swordfish are found in the Mediterranean Sea, south of the Italian peninsula and Sicily (2).  Swordfish eggs have been found here from June to September, and large numbers of juveniles occur throughout the Mediterranean from November to March (2).  Fertilization is external (3), whereby a female releases millions of buoyant eggs into the water, which are then fertilised by sperm secreted by the male.  From the fertilised eggs hatch swordfish larvae.  At only four millimetres long, with a short snout, and distinct, prickly scales (4), the larvae is vastly different to the great predator it will become.  During the first year of life the larvae grow at a phenomenal rate, reaching a length of 90 centimetres (3).

The penguins tear up plants to use as nest material and fertilise the ground with their droppings, resulting in grass growing well the subsequent year, hence their favourable reputation with sheep farmers (5).\u00a0Into these nests two white, spherical eggs are laid, which are incubated by both the male and female for 31 to 39 days (2).

Although populations closer to the equator, such as India, Australia, and central and southern Africa, tend to be sedentary, some do make small migrations in association with the seasons as well as in response to food supply and rainfall (4).\u00a0The hugely diverse range of food consumed by black kites varies from region to region and across the seasons. All types of carrion form an important part of this species' diet, but a notable variety of live prey, such as insects, reptiles, birds and small mammals, are also taken by this agile raptor. In urban environments, black kites are known to forage on human food scraps and garbage, and daringly steal food from market stalls and even people (4). Flocks of black kites are also commonly seen gathering around bush fires to pick off the hapless animals feeing the flames (6).\u00a0The black kite is an extremely gregarious species, particularly when feeding or roosting, with several thousand birds sometimes coming together in one area. Some pairs may breed solitarily but usually loose groups are formed, as is commonly seen in urban areas where nests may be made only a few metres apart. Aside from high circling, slow flapping and diving, the aerial displays during courtship are fairly limited but occasionally a pair will interlock talons in mid-air. The nests are built on tree branches, cliff ledges, pylons or buildings and are made from sticks and twigs lined with softer material, often comprised of rags and plastic (4). The typical clutch size is two to three eggs which are incubated by the female for around a month before hatching (4) (6).

Utilising this specialized technique it is able to obtain huge quantities of the crustaceans, molluscs, aquatic insects, polychaete worms, and algae on which it depends. It is the presence of certain carotenoids in the algae and crustaceans that give the flamingo its distinctively coloured plumage (2) (4).\u00a0The Caribbean flamingo is a highly social species, with colonies ranging in size from just a few dozen to hundreds of thousands of individual birds during the breeding season (2) (4). Group courtship displays are typical of this flamingo, with thousands of individuals raising their wings, turning their heads, or bowing their necks in spectacular synchrony. Engaging in these displays ensures that all members of the colony are ready to mate at the same time (4). Both sexes are involved in building the nest from bits of mud piled into a smooth cone, and spaced just beyond pecking distance of other pairs' nests. Usually just a single egg is laid, which is incubated by both parents over 27 to 31 days (2).

However, home ranges overlap, and groups, numbering between 3 and 20 individuals, may come into contact. In such circumstances females will attempt to intimidate the opposing group by staring, and occasionally will fight briefly before retreating to the centre of the range (2).\u00a0Following increased scent marking by females (5), mating takes place in a short period in mid April, resulting in synchronous births four months later in August and September (2). The purpose of this careful timing is to ensure that the young are weaned just as fruit becomes plentiful. Males compete for access to females, daubing their tails with scent from their wrist glands and wafting this pungent odour towards their opponent. These stink fights are commonly sufficient to establish rank, but fights can occur. Males might move between groups during the mating season to impregnate as many females as possible. After 134 \u2013 138 days of gestation the females give birth to one or occasionally two young (3). Groups of females share the parental duties and form cr\u00e8ches.

From their early uses in carrying vehicles and pulling loads, horses have been selected into hundreds of specialized breeds used around the world for transportation (either ridden or harnessed to convey wheeled vehicles), agriculture (to pull equipment and ride after cattle), and war (for carrying troops into battle and carting equipment), as well as in numerous competition and show disciplines, ranging from racing to Olympic sports (dressage, jumping, and eventing\u2014a 3-part competition that includes dressage, cross-country, and show jumping) to various Western and rodeo events, including reining, barrel-racing, and team penning, as well as in therapy work. Most horses are domesticated, but there are some feral populations in isolated pockets around the world.\r\n\r\nHorses are medium to large mammals, with long heads and necks with a mane. Their legs are slender and end in a single toe, protected by a horny hoof. They have long, slender tails, either ending in a tuft, or entirely covered in flowing hair. They are adapted to generally open terrain, from plains and savannas, to mountains or deserts. Equines are one of only two mammals (the other is the human) capable of producing copious sweat perspiration for thermoregulatory cooling, enabling fast running over long distances.\r\n\r\nHorses are herbivores, and feed predominantly on tough, fibrous food, such as grasses and sedges. When in need, they will also eat other vegetable matter, such as leaves, fruits, or bark, but are normally grazers, not browsers. Unlike ruminants, with their complex stomachs, equines break down cellulose in the \"hindgut\" or caecum, a part of the colon.\r\n\r\nEquus caballus sylvaticus, the Forest or Diluvian Horse, appears to be the ancestor of the modern draft and heavyweight breeds; these horses were slow-moving and stoutly built, with coarse, thick coats, manes, and tails. Equus caballus gmelini Antonius, the Tarpan horse, from eastern Europe and the steppes of southern Russia, had a smaller, lighter build, but was hardy, strong and speedy; many pony and light horse breeds are believed to have evolved from this lineage. Equus caballus przewalskii prsewalskii Poliakov, the Asiatic horse, was discovered in the wild in Mongolia in 1879, and a few populations still live in the wild in eastern Asia, as well as in zoos. Although the Asiatic horse, which is hardy, cold-resistant and dun with darker mane and tail, is considered to be ancestral to many breeds, it has a different chromosome number (33, vs. the 32 found in modern horse breeds). Differing lineages or combinations of the three original subspecies in turn yielded four general types of ponies and horses from which all modern breeds derive.\r\n\r\nThe horse was first domesticated 5,000 to 6,000 years ago, perhaps earlier. Horses appear to have been domesticated in conjunction with the evolution of agriculture. From this start, horse breeds were developed and used in warfare and for transportation.\r\n\r\n(McBane 2005, Wikipedia 2012.)", "sid": 328648, "picture": "http://media.eol.org/content/2014/09/29/01/45473_orig.jpg", "scientific_name": "Equus caballus Linnaeus, 1758", "web_url": "http://www.eol.org/pages/328648", "thumb": "http://media.eol.org/content/2014/09/29/01/45473_98_68.jpg"}, "1049641": {"common_name": "Roseate Tern", "text": "In Britain and Ireland, the diet consists mainly of small fish, especially sand eels (5), which are caught by plunge-diving (2) or are stolen from other tern species (5).The roseate tern arrives back in Britain later than other terns and soon starts to lay eggs (5).

Trouvelot was interested in producing a hardy silk producing moth, and imported L. dispar eggs which escaped into his back yard in Medford, Massachusetts.  Shortly after this, in 1889, the first gypsy moth outbreak in the United States occurred in the Boston area.  Gypsy moths have since spread throughout the Northeast, Canada, and the Midwest, despite huge efforts to eradicate this pest.  An outbreak of gypsy moth caterpillars can very quickly and effectively defoliate forests.  Spread of this species represents a significant risk especially to hardwood trees, their preferred hosts, but since the gypsy moth has a wide diet, most types of trees are affected.  Since 1980, the gypsy moth has defoliated about a million forested acres each year.  Infestations occur cyclically, with populations reaching outbreak levels every 5-10 years.  The USDA has a coordinated Federal-state program to control populations and limit at least the human propagated spread of the Gypsy moth from currently quarantined states into new areas. The Gypsy Moth quarantine currently includes the District of Columbia and the entire states of Connecticut, Delaware, Maryland, Massachusetts, Michigan, New Hampshire, New Jersey, New York, Pennsylvania, Rhode Island and Vermont.  As well as spreading in concert with humans, populations can naturally spread by female moths flying to uninfested areas, or at the larval (caterpillar) stage, which are carried on the wind by their silk threads.   The government has developed another interesting control program which sprays effected areas with an engineered baculovirus, which is very effective in killing the caterpillars.  The baculovirus works by changing the nocturnally-feeding caterpillars behavior, so that they remain high in the forest canopy instead of their usual return to daytime hiding places on the ground.  When the virus then kills the caterpillar, the caterpillar's flesh dissolves and the virus rains down from the top of the tree and is widely spread to other caterpillars below. The asian subspecies of Lymantria dispar, although similar to the European subspecies described above, has never become established in North America.  Because it is a stronger flier than the European subspecies, and presumably could quickly spread throughout the US, it is considered a major threat and carefully monitored at likely entry pathways.

Over most of the range, Downy Woodpeckers produce just one brood per year. \r\n\r\nAlthough these woodpeckers are permanent residents over much of their range, the northernmost populations may move significantly southward in winter. Some birds in the mountains of the West may move down into valleys (as well as short distances to the south) in winter.\r\n\r\n(Confer and Paicos 1985; Kaufman 1996; AOU 1998; Dunn and Alderfer 2011)\r\n\r\n", "sid": 1047051, "picture": "http://media.eol.org/content/2015/06/04/10/78038_orig.jpg", "scientific_name": "Picoides pubescens", "web_url": "http://www.eol.org/pages/1047051", "thumb": "http://media.eol.org/content/2015/06/04/10/78038_98_68.jpg"}, "308387": {"common_name": "Okapi", "text": "Most of the information about the biology of the okapi is from captive animals (2). They are largely solitary (2) and though once thought to be nocturnal (6), are now known to be active during the day (2). They feed largely on leaves, grasses, fruits and fungi, some of which are known to be poisonous. It has been suggested that this is why okapis eat charcoal from burned forest trees, as is evidenced from their dung (2). Carbon, in the form of charcoal, is an excellent antidote for toxin ingestion and recent observations in Zanzibar found red colobus monkeys eating charcoal from native cooking fires and kilns (7). It is also known that many other animals find sources of kaolin, a type of clay, to offset the effects of poisonous leaves and fruit in their diet.\u00a0Male and female okapi live in home ranges, but they are not territorial and these ranges overlap (3). From observations on captive animals, it appears that male okapis mark their ranges with urine, by crossing their front legs, urinating on them, and then walking through their range. They will also urinate directly onto plants. Both males and females rub their necks against tree trunks (3).\u00a0Mothers will not stray very far after giving birth, so the young okapi will remain close by until at least a few days old, in what is known as a 'follower phase' (3). It then becomes a 'nester' for a number of months, in which it lies in vegetation. During this intensive nesting phase, the calf is extremely efficient in the use of energy, primarily only nursing or sleeping. Towards the end of the intensive nesting phase, the calf can maintain its temperature properly, and so activates its rumens, and defecates for the first time (3). This is thought to be a defence against predators (2). Okapi mothers use infrasonic communication to communicate with their calves. This is sound that is below the range of human hearing \u2013 also used by elephants (3).\u00a0The young are weaned at six months old although they may continue to take milk for some time afterwards. The males begin developing their horns at about one year and reach their adult size at the age of three. They are believed to reach sexual maturity around two years old (2). Captive individuals have been known to live for up to 33 years (3).", "sid": 308387, "picture": "http://media.eol.org/content/2014/04/14/13/68038_orig.jpg", "scientific_name": "Okapia johnstoni", "web_url": "http://www.eol.org/pages/308387", "thumb": "http://media.eol.org/content/2014/04/14/13/68038_98_68.jpg"}, "1049497": {"common_name": "Dunlin", "text": "While many North Americans know this medium-sized (8-9 inches) sandpiper as a plain, gray bird of the winter shoreline, the Dunlin has a summer plumage which is much more striking.

In winter, this species sheds its summer colors and becomes gray above with a white breast and gray throat. Male and female Dunlins are similar in summer and winter plumages. The Dunlin breeds across arctic and subarctic regions of the Northern Hemisphere. In North America, this species breeds primarily along northwestern portions of the Hudson Bay, with smaller populations breeding in Alaska and the islands in the Canadian arctic. Most Dunlin breeding in North America winter along both coasts of the continent south to central Mexico. In the Old World, this species breeds across northern Russia, Northern Europe, and Iceland, wintering as far south as the Mediterranean Sea, West Africa, South Asia, and the Oceania. In summer, Dunlins breed on relatively wet, boggy tundra. During the winter, this species primarily inhabits shorelines of sandy beaches, although some birds winter on agricultural land in California\u2019s Central Valley. The diet of the Dunlin is comprised mostly of small aquatic invertebrates such as crustaceans and mollusks, although insects may also be eaten when available. Due to its remote breeding habitat, most birdwatchers never see the Dunlin during the summer.

Northern and southern populations never meet because the seasonal patterns are reversed in the two hemispheres, and so they migrate to the equator at different times of year (5). Mating takes place in winter, and as gestation takes about 11 months, births occur in the winter breeding grounds where conception took place (5). A single calf is produced, which is suckled for six to seven months; when weaned, calves travel with their mother to the feeding grounds (5). Females produce calves every couple of years after reaching sexual maturity at three to twelve years of age.

Breeding is mainly in loose colonies of 10 to 20 pairs. Nest building is initiated by an unmated male, but assisted by his mate after pair formation.  Nests are typically built in artificial or natural cavities or crevices.  These birds are remarkably catholic in their choice of a nest site, with nests reported from moving machinery and even from 640 m below ground in a coal mine in England.  Clutch size is typically 3 to 6 eggs.  Incubation (for 10 to 14 days) is by both parents. Both parents also feed the nestlings, which leave the nest around two weeks after hatching.
