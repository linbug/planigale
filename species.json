Getting at winter feed by digging through the snow can lead to intense competition, which may explain why females also carry antlers. During the breeding season, males compete with one another for access to females, using their antlers in jousting matches. They become completely devoted to the rituals of mating, failing even to eat, and losing their built up energy reserves in the process. Females give birth at traditional calving grounds on the open tundra during the spring, after a gestation of seven months. Then they pour all of their energy reserves into nursing their calves for a month.

Trouvelot was interested in producing a hardy silk producing moth, and imported L. dispar eggs which escaped into his back yard in Medford, Massachusetts.  Shortly after this, in 1889, the first gypsy moth outbreak in the United States occurred in the Boston area.  Gypsy moths have since spread throughout the Northeast, Canada, and the Midwest, despite huge efforts to eradicate this pest.  An outbreak of gypsy moth caterpillars can very quickly and effectively defoliate forests.  Spread of this species represents a significant risk especially to hardwood trees, their preferred hosts, but since the gypsy moth has a wide diet, most types of trees are affected.  Since 1980, the gypsy moth has defoliated about a million forested acres each year.  Infestations occur cyclically, with populations reaching outbreak levels every 5-10 years.  The USDA has a coordinated Federal-state program to control populations and limit at least the human propagated spread of the Gypsy moth from currently quarantined states into new areas. The Gypsy Moth quarantine currently includes the District of Columbia and the entire states of Connecticut, Delaware, Maryland, Massachusetts, Michigan, New Hampshire, New Jersey, New York, Pennsylvania, Rhode Island and Vermont.  As well as spreading in concert with humans, populations can naturally spread by female moths flying to uninfested areas, or at the larval (caterpillar) stage, which are carried on the wind by their silk threads.   The government has developed another interesting control program which sprays effected areas with an engineered baculovirus, which is very effective in killing the caterpillars.  The baculovirus works by changing the nocturnally-feeding caterpillars behavior, so that they remain high in the forest canopy instead of their usual return to daytime hiding places on the ground.  When the virus then kills the caterpillar, the caterpillar's flesh dissolves and the virus rains down from the top of the tree and is widely spread to other caterpillars below. The asian subspecies of Lymantria dispar, although similar to the European subspecies described above, has never become established in North America.  Because it is a stronger flier than the European subspecies, and presumably could quickly spread throughout the US, it is considered a major threat and carefully monitored at likely entry pathways.

Females are ovoviviparous; the pups hatch from eggs retained within their mother's body, and she then gives birth to live young (10).

After birth, there is no maternal care, and despite their large size, survival of young is thought to be low (8).&nbsp;Great whites are at the top of the marine food chain, and these sharks are skilled predators. They feed predominately on fish but will also consume turtles, molluscs, and crustaceans, and are active hunters of small cetaceans such as dolphins and porpoises, and of other marine mammals such as seals and sea lions (12). Using their acute senses of smell, sound location and electroreception, weak and injured prey can be detected from a great distance (7). Efficient swimmers, sharks have a quick turn of speed and will attack rapidly before backing off whilst the prey becomes weakened; they are sometimes seen leaping clear of the water (6).

The skin ranges from yellow to brown in color, and the shell is typically reddish-brown. No external differences in gender are seen until the turtle becomes an adult, the most obvious difference being the adult males have thicker tails and shorter plastrons than the females.", "Adults are primarily carnivorous, using their powerful jaws to crack open crustaceans such as crabs and even seemingly impenetrable molluscs such as the queen conch (Strombus gigas) and giant clam (Tridacna spp.) (7). Loggerheads may reach sexual maturity at around 35 years old, and females appear to nest an average of three to five times in one breeding season, returning to breed every couple of years (8).  Nesting occurs at night throughout the summer; females drag themselves out onto beaches beyond the high-tide mark and dig nests (around 40 centimetres deep) into which around 100 eggs are laid (2). Hatchlings and small juveniles appear to spend some time in pelagic environments, often drifting amongst rafts of sargassum (brown algae) and/or flotsam in the open ocean before migrating to benthic habitats in shallower, coastal waters (6)."], "py/object": "__main__.Species"}, {"thumbs_list": ["http://media.eol.org/content/2015/12/01/12/08661_98_68.jpg", "http://media.eol.org/content/2013/02/14/16/27859_98_68.jpg"], "common_name": "Bald Eagle", "scientific_name": "Haliaeetus leucocephalus (Linnaeus, 1766)", "images_list": ["http://media.eol.org/content/2015/12/01/12/08661_orig.jpg", "http://media.eol.org/content/2013/02/14/16/27859_orig.jpg"], "web_url": "http://www.eol.org/pages/1049121", "text_list": ["Cope&#39;s giant salamander is found in the Puget lowland forests along with several other western North America ecoregions.

Although fully capable of excavating its own burrow, the burrowing owl most commonly occupies the abandoned burrows of mammals (2). In the northern part of its range it commonly uses the burrows of prairie dogs, while in South America, as noted by the famous naturalist Charles Darwin, it inhabits burrows made by large, rabbit-like rodents called viscachas (6). Interestingly, burrowing owls purposefully deposit piles of mammal dung around the entrance of their burrows. This unusual behaviour has been shown to be a method of baiting, as the dung attracts numerous dung beetles, which the owl then feeds upon (7). Aside from invertebrates, the burrowing owl will also take small mammals, birds and reptiles, either pursing its prey on foot or diving down upon it from the air or a perch (2). Outside the breeding season, this species rests in its burrow during the day and mainly hunts at dusk, during the night, and at dawn. During breeding, however, burrowing owls may forage at any point during the day or night (2) (4).&nbsp;During the spring breeding season, burrowing owls form monogamous pairs, which maintain a small territory comprising the nesting burrow and the immediate surroundings. The female lays a clutch of up to 11 eggs, which are incubated for around one month, while the male brings food. In the initial period after hatching, the female remains with the young and is supported by the male, but as the young become more developed the female leaves the burrow and assists the male in foraging for food. After around 44 days the young leave the burrow and join the parent birds on hunting flights (2).&nbsp;While many burrowing owl breeding pairs remain resident around a burrow throughout the year, individuals from Canada and the northern USA are migratory. At the end of the breeding season, pairs in these regions split up and fly south to overwinter, before returning in the following spring and establishing a new breeding pair with a different partner (2).", "This taxon is found in the Chihuahuan Desert, which is one of the most biologically diverse arid regions on Earth.

Ornithorhynchus (bird-snout) replaced it, but the species name anatinus (duck-like) remained the same.The original specimen described by Shaw is currently stored with our research collections.MorphologyNo other animal on Earth looks quite like the platypus. The most distinctive feature is the bill, which is not hard like the bill of a duck but soft and pliable. It is well supplied with nerves and is used by the animal to locate food and to find its way around under water.Platypuses lose their deciduous juvenile teeth a short time after the young leave the nesting burrows. They are replaced by horny pads made of keratin.Built for swimming and diggingPlatypuses are covered with dense, waterproof fur, except on their feet and bill. They have a streamlined shape, short limbs and propels themselves through the water using alternate kicks of their webbed front limbs. These webs of the forefeet are folded back when the animal is walking or burrowing to expose strong claws.Behind the bill on either side of the head are 2 grooves that house the ear openings and the eyes which close when the platypus dives. The nostrils are on top of the bill, not far back from the tip.The skeleton is streamlined but heavy enough to support large muscles for swimming and digging. Other key featuresEach of the males\u2019 rear legs bears a horny spur on the ankle of about 1.5cm in length. This hollow spur is connected to a venom gland in the upper leg.The tail consists mainly of fatty tissue and acts as a fat storage area.Interestingly, the platypus skeleton shows reptilian and marsupial features:Between the collar bone and the sternum the platypus has a distinctively T-shape bone called the interclavicle, which is also found in modern reptiles.Like marsupials, the platypus has two epipubic bones attached to its pelvic girdle.The legs are splayed rather like those of reptiles but they rotate in their sockets like those of mammals.

Even after the specimens were found to be authentic, it was sometime before scientists concluded that the 'amphibious mole' was in fact a mammal, albeit the most evolutionary distinct mammal alive (3) (5) (6). The distinctive features that make the platypus so instantly recognisable are its duck-like bill, dense, waterproof fur, webbed feet, and broad, flattened tail (3) (7) (8). The plush pelage that covers its stream-lined body is deep brown above, and silvery grey to yellow underneath (3) (6) (8).

Vinago. According to Linnaeus the species was bluish-grey with a glossy green neck and a black bar on his tail and wings. (\u201ccaerulescens, collo supra viridi-nitente, fascia alarum apiceque caudae nigricante\u201d). He named this pigeon Columba oenas, and that was quite a good description of the stock dove indeed.However, Linnaeus did not mean the stock dove specific. He meant all pigeons, wild and tame, what in his opinion meet this description. So both the stock dove and the rock pigeon and all tame pigeons with a comparable plumage colour. According to him it was all the same species. However, within the species oenas Linnaeus distinguished specifically the so called tame pigeons or dovecote pigeons. This variety he called Columba domestica. Besides their colour these pigeons didn\u2019t differ at all from the \u2018wild form\u2019.Next Linnaeus described a few domesticated breeds as if they where original forms (species). Because he mentioned them apart from his oenas and domestica it is obvious that he didn\u2019t know these pigeons actually were domesticated forms. Also in the 12th edition of his Systema Naturea he still didn\u2019t know and among others he mentioned as being original species the following pigeons:Columba hispanica (runt)Columba cucullata (Jacobin)Columba turbita (Turbit)Columba laticauda (Fantail)Columba gyratrix (Tumbler)Columba turcica (Indian)Columba tabellaria (Carrier)Columba hispida (silky feathered pigeon)Columba gutturosa (Pouter)Between 1788 and 1793 Gmelin\u2019s revision of Linnaeus\u2019 13th edition was published. In Tom I.2 (1789) Gmelin mentioned Columba oenas as well but he did mean the Stock dove only. And he also described Columba domestica, but now separated from oenas.According to Gmelin this \u2018Common Pigeon\u2019 is ash-grey with a white rump and a black bar on the tail and wings (\u201ccinerea, uropygio albo, alurum fascia, caudaeque apice nigricante\u201d). Just like Linnaeus Gmelin described next a few related, but distinguishable forms of which we know nowadays it are domesticated breeds. It\u2019s remarkable that he discerned these forms (20 in total) as varieties of Columba domestica. This may indicate that Gmelin knew that all those pigeons derived from each other. But at least he knew they had nothing to do with the stock dove.The first variety within domestica he started with is Columba livia. Most important difference between domestica and livia, according to Gmelin, is the double bar on the wings (\u201calarum fascia duplici\u201d). Who originated from who was still not yet completely clear. However, by this Gmelin was the first who had scientifically named the rock pigeon. If he really meant the wild rock pigeon, or tame pigeons with the same colour, is not clear but that does not matter.

This species is mainly associated with humans, living around buildings in settings ranging from isolated rural farms to major urban centers, although population density and breeding success are generally higher in suburban environments than in cities or rural areas.\r\n\r\nHouse Sparrows have a mainly vegetarian diet, feeding especially on weed and grass seeds or waste grain, but also on buds, berries, and a range of scraps from humans. During the summer, animal material can account for as much as 10% of the diet and, as opportunists, House Sparrows may take small frogs. mollusks, and crustaceans where available. Nestlings are fed mainly insects for the first few days after hatching .\r\n\r\nHouse Sparrows generally occur in flocks, often quite large ones outside the breeding season. Breeding is mainly in loose colonies of 10 to 20 pairs. Nest building is initiated by an unmated male, but assisted by his mate after pair formation.  Nests are typically built in artificial or natural cavities or crevices.  These birds are remarkably catholic in their choice of a nest site, with nests reported from moving machinery and even from 640 m below ground in a coal mine in England.  Clutch size is typically 3 to 6 eggs.  Incubation (for 10 to 14 days) is by both parents. Both parents also feed the nestlings, which leave the nest around two weeks after hatching. Two or three clutches are typically produced each year.\r\n  \r\nHouse Sparrows are non-migratory over most of their native and introduced range.  This species is among the more abundant birds in the world: the total European population in the 1980s and 1990s probably exceeded 50,000,000 breeding pairs, with an estimated world total of around 500,000,000 pairs. However, significant population declines have been reported in recent years over parts of  the native and introduced range (although range expansion elsewhere has continued).\r\n\r\n(Kaufman 1996; Summers-Smith 2009 and references therein)\r\n", "House sparrows feed mainly on seeds, but in the breeding season the adults will take some animal matter (mainly insects), and feed their young on insects for the first part of the nestling period (9). It is a regular visitor to garden bird tables and feeders (5).&nbsp;This sociable species nests in colonies, the untidy feather-lined nests are built in crevices and holes in buildings, tree holes and nest boxes (4). House sparrows are also known to occasionally evict other species of birds from their nests, subsequently occupying them (6). During the breeding season, house sparrows mate very frequently, so much so that their eggs were once highly prized as aphrodisiacs (6). After May, 3-5 whitish, blotched eggs are laid (4). The female incubates the eggs for up to 14 days, after which time both parents share the task of feeding the young for around 15 days (4). Three or more broods may be produced every breeding season (4).&nbsp;The gregarious nature of this sparrow is often most obvious during winter, when most activities including feeding, roosting and bathing, are carried out in groups or large flocks (5)."], "py/object": "__main__.Species"}, {"thumbs_list": ["http://media.eol.org/content/2013/11/18/23/76432_98_68.jpg", "http://media.eol.org/content/2013/11/02/03/83932_98_68.jpg"], "common_name": "Jay", "scientific_name": "Garrulus glandarius (Linnaeus, 1758)", "images_list": ["http://media.eol.org/content/2013/11/18/23/76432_orig.jpg", "http://media.eol.org/content/2013/11/02/03/83932_orig.jpg"], "web_url": "http://www.eol.org/pages/916527", "text_list": ["The typical jays of the genus Garrulus number only 3 species. The Eurasian jay is polytypic and has an extensive range, while the other two, Lanceolated jay and Lidth\u2019s jay, have relatively tiny ranges. They are characterized by similar and undoubtedly homologous blue-and-black barred feathers on the wings and/or tail. Also by traces of similar barring on the head feathers in most cases, and a strong resemblance in movements, ecology and voice.They appear most closely related on one hand to the green and blue magpies of the genus Cissa and on the other to the boreal jays of the genus Perisoreus, to which they seem to be linked by the Sooty jay P. internigrans. Over the greater part of their combined ranges the species of Garullus are completely allopatric but the Eurasian jay and the Lanceolated jay overlap in the Western Himalayas.The Eurasian jay has a much more extensive range than either of its congeners. Within its range it shows considerable geographic variation. Some populations now appear to be completely isolated from their nearest relatives by sea or unsuitable terrain. As, however, at least as far as their taxonomic characters are concerned, the most divers forms are connected by intergrades and no instance is known of two forms coming together and not interbreeding to form a mixed population, they seem best all treated as members of a single polytypic species.Within each major group of the more diverse forms, numerous races (or one might better say micro-races) of the jay have been named and recognized. Sometimes, it seems, those who have done so had an ability to recognize geographical variation in inverse relation to their ability to recognize individual variation. However, the numerous races within the species can be divided in five comprehensive major racial groups.Glandarius groupCrown of head streaked or blackWhite patch on secondariesCheeks white or

shallows, the Caribbean flamingo's great size enables it to wade out into relatively deep water. It rarely takes food from the surface, but instead generally feeds with its whole head submerged underwater. With its bill held only slightly open, it filters out food particles by allowing water to pass across rows of tiny comb-like plates on the bill's edges (4). Utilising this specialized technique it is able to obtain huge quantities of the crustaceans, molluscs, aquatic insects, polychaete worms, and algae on which it depends. It is the presence of certain carotenoids in the algae and crustaceans that give the flamingo its distinctively coloured plumage (2) (4).&nbsp;The Caribbean flamingo is a highly social species, with colonies ranging in size from just a few dozen to hundreds of thousands of individual birds during the breeding season (2) (4). Group courtship displays are typical of this flamingo, with thousands of individuals raising their wings, turning their heads, or bowing their necks in spectacular synchrony. Engaging in these displays ensures that all members of the colony are ready to mate at the same time (4). Both sexes are involved in building the nest from bits of mud piled into a smooth cone, and spaced just beyond pecking distance of other pairs' nests. Usually just a single egg is laid, which is incubated by both parents over 27 to 31 days (2). Around six to eight days after hatching, the chicks leave the nests and gather in large cr\u00e8ches, overseen by a small number of adults, and eventually fledge at around 9 to 13 weeks (2) (4).&nbsp;Although the Caribbean flamingo is generally considered to be non-migratory, it is extremely nomadic, and will travel hundreds of kilometres in response to shifting resources (2). Large flocks form long, curving lines in flight, with each bird flying with its neck and legs distinctively outstretched (2) (4).", "Length: 136-172 cm ; 127-140 cm .

This species may be distinguished from the similar White-winged Dove (Zenaida asiatica) by that species\u2019 blue eye-stripes, rounded tail, and white wing patches. Male and female Mourning Doves are similar to one another in all seasons. The Mourning Dove breeds across much of the North American continent south of southern Canada. Northerly-breeding populations migrate south to southern Mexico and Central America during the winter, whereas populations breeding further south in the U.S.and Mexico are non-migratory. Other non-migratory populations exist in the West Indies and at scattered locations in Central America. Mourning Doves inhabit a number of habitats across this species\u2019 wide range, including woodland edges, bushy fields, meadows, and scrubland. This species has also adapted to living near humans, and visits agricultural fields as well as urban and suburban areas where food is available. Mourning Doves almost exclusively eat seeds and grains. Throughout the North American continent, Mourning Doves may be seen foraging for food on the ground or perched on trees limbs, fence posts, and power lines. This species\u2019 call, a melancholy \u201cCOO-coo, coo, coo,\u201d and the whistle made by the wings of these birds as they fly, are an integral part of the avian soundscape across most of North America.

Some pairs may breed solitarily but usually loose groups are formed, as is commonly seen in urban areas where nests may be made only a few metres apart. Aside from high circling, slow flapping and diving, the aerial displays during courtship are fairly limited but occasionally a pair will interlock talons in mid-air. The nests are built on tree branches, cliff ledges, pylons or buildings and are made from sticks and twigs lined with softer material, often comprised of rags and plastic (4).

The species is migratory, with northern populations moving southwards during the winter, and southern populations sometimes wintering on the coast or moving to Central America or the Caribbean (2) (5) (8)."], "py/object": "__main__.Species"}, {"thumbs_list": ["http://media.eol.org/content/2012/06/13/04/81021_98_68.jpg", "http://media.eol.org/content/2012/06/13/04/70509_98_68.jpg"], "common_name": "Narwhal", "scientific_name": "Monodon monoceros Linnaeus, 1758", "images_list": ["http://media.eol.org/content/2012/06/13/04/81021_orig.jpg", "http://media.eol.org/content/2012/06/13/04/70509_orig.jpg"], "web_url": "http://www.eol.org/pages/328542", "text_list": ["\"The narwhal's tusk is a tooth - an upper-jaw tooth that grows through the lip and keeps on growing. Narwhals have just two teeth, both in the upper jaw. Usually the right tooth remains small and the left one grows to become the tusk. It can weigh more than 10 kg and grow to 3 m long; an average-size male narwhal, not counting the tusk, is 4.76 m long. Very rarely, males grow two tusks, and now and then a female develops a tusk. Tusks probably play a role in breeding competition. Narwhals migrate, wintering in pack ice and summering in deep sounds and fjords. They make deep dives - satellite transmitters are beginning to provide information on their diving habits - and feed near the bottom, probably capturing their prey by suction and swallowing it whole. Killer whales and polar bears are predators, and humans hunt them for their skin, meat, and ivory tusks.\"Links:Mammal Species of the WorldClick here for The American Society of Mammalogists species account", "Narwhal (Monodon monoceros) adalah mamalia air yang hidup di kutub utara, terkenal akan tanduknya, yang masuk kedalam famili Monodontidae (salah satu dari dua spesies paus yang termasuk kedalam famili ini bersama dengan Delphinapterus leucas). Mereka hidup di wilayah pantai dan sungai di kutub utara. Mereka bermigrasi musiman, berpindah antara teluk dan fjord di musim panas dan laut dalam lepas pantai yang tertutup es pada musim dingin. Pada musim panas mereka bergerak mendekat ke pantai yang merupakan perairan yang tidak tertutup es (biasanya merupakan perairan dangkal) lalu kembali menjauhi pantai pada musim dingin menuju ke perairan yang lebih dalam dengan permukaan yang tertutupi es tebal walau demikian terkadang mereka muncul ke permukaan melalui celah-celah kecil di es (Laidre et al, 2002). Mereka cenderung menyukai perairan dalam atau laut lepas hampir di semua area kemunculannya dan sangat jarang terlihat dibawah 65o lintang utara (Hay and Manfield, 1989). Hidup di perairan dalam dengan suhu ekstrim pada musim dingin tidak menjadi masalah karena didukung dengan kemampuan untuk menyelam dengan kedalaman yang sangat dalam dan lemak tubuh yang hampir sepertiga (35%) total berat tubuhnya.

for the most part, an easy bird to identify. At 42-52 inches, its gray-blue back, buff neck, yellow bill, white face, and long, black facial plumes help to distinguish it from most other waders in its range. The all-white Caribbean subspecies, which enters our area in south Florida, may be distinguished from the similarly-colored Great Egret by its yellow legs and feet. Male and female Great Blue Herons are similar at all times of the year. The Great Blue Heron breeds across the majority of the United States and southern Canada. Great Blue Herons that breed in southern Canada and the northern Great Plains migrate south for the winter, when they may be found in Central America and the Caribbean. Populations living in most of the U.S.are non-migratory. This species is absent from the desert southwest and from high elevations of the Rocky Mountains. Great Blue Herons live in and around small bodies of water. In summer, Great Blue Herons nest in colonies, called \u2018rookeries,\u2019 surrounding lakes and ponds. They may nest either in trees, in bushes, or on the ground. This species utilizes similar habitats during the winter. Great Blue Herons mainly eat fish, but may also take crustaceans and small vertebrates (such as frogs, lizards, and mice) when the opportunity arises. Great Blue Herons may be best observed wading in shallow water, where they may be seen plunging their bills into the water to catch fish. It is also possible to see Great Blue Herons at their rookeries, especially when they return to roost at sunset, or while flying with their feet extended and their necks pulled in. Great Blue Herons are primarily active during the day.", "At over a metre and half in height, the great blue heron is the largest heron in North America and one of the continent's most recognisable wading birds (2) (3). There are two main colour morphs of this statuesque species: a dark form that is mostly blue-grey, with chestnut thighs, and a white cap over a black eye stripe that merges into long, black plumes; and a light form which is all white. The neck, legs and wings are characteristically long, the tail is short, and the yellowish bill is thick, elongate and tapered. In flight, it coils its neck back into a distinctive s-shape, extends its legs back along its body axis, and beats its wings with steady, powerful strokes (2) (3) (4). Although the sexes are similar in appearance, the female is normally around ten percent smaller than the male, while juveniles are duller and lack the long plumes of the adults (4) (5). Considerable uncertainty surrounds the separation of subspecies of the great blue heron, with between two and seven recognised for North America alone (4). However, five main subspecies, that differ in size and plumage and occupy different parts of the species overall range, are commonly referred to: Ardea herodias herodias, A. h. fannini, A. h. wardii, A. h. occidentalis (the white form), and A. h. cognata  (2) (4)."], "py/object": "__main__.Species"}, {"thumbs_list": ["http://media.eol.org/content/2014/12/25/21/51704_98_68.jpg", "http://media.eol.org/content/2012/06/13/02/80467_98_68.jpg"], "common_name": "mountain goat", "scientific_name": "Oreamnos americanus (de Blainville, 1816)", "images_list": ["http://media.eol.org/content/2014/12/25/21/51704_orig.jpg", "http://media.eol.org/content/2012/06/13/02/80467_orig.jpg"], "web_url": "http://www.eol.org/pages/328659", "text_list": ["Mountain Goats live on remarkably steep, craggy cliffs for most of their lives, spending only about a quarter of their time in less forbidding meadows and nearby fields. The steep slopes offer safety from predators such as mountain lions and grizzly bears. The Goats eat vegetation that grows in small pockets of earth that collect among the rocks. Even when migrating to lower elevations during winter, the Goats stay on steep slopes above the timberline. There, high winds scour snow from the rocks, exposing food for forage. Special adaptations enable Mountain Goats to navigate rock faces.

Due to this species\u2019 need to scavenge for food, Turkey Vultures are most easily observed soaring high above the ground in search of carrion. Scientists have discovered that this species possesses a more developed sense of smell than the Black Vulture, and that Black Vultures often wait for Turkey Vultures to find food before driving them off and taking the carcass for themselves. This species is primarily active during the day.", "Active during the day, the turkey vulture is commonly encountered perched, with wings outstretched in the morning sun. The reason for this behaviour is not entirely clear, but it may be to dry out the feathers, prior to taking to the air (3). Once aloft, this species is a graceful flyer, often gliding close to the ground, with wings angled upwards forming a slight V-shape (3) (4). The turkey vulture feeds almost exclusively on carrion and, unlike most birds, has a highly developed sense of smell, which it uses to locate carcasses, even under a cover of vegetation. This ability means that the turkey vulture is often the first scavenger to arrive at a carcass, allowing it to feed before the arrival of larger birds of prey, which drive this species away (2) (5). In response to its diet of rotting meat, the turkey vulture has evolved a remarkably high tolerance for microbial toxins, and plays an important ecological role in disposing of carcasses that could otherwise breed disease (5). Unlike some larger vultures, the turkey vulture very rarely kills, and only tackles sick or injured animals, nestlings and insects (2) (5).&nbsp;The turkey vulture's breeding season varies according to location, with populations in temperate parts of North America laying eggs between May and June, while populations in Central America lay between February and April (2). Breeding in tropical parts of South America is less well known (2), although egg-laying has been recorded between August and January in Chile (5). Turkey vultures do not provide nesting material, and simply lay a clutch of two eggs directly on the ground in shallow caves or under dense undergrowth, or alternatively in a hollow tree stump or log. After 38 to 41 days of incubation, the eggs hatch, and the young are brooded for a further 70 to 80 days before fledging (2).&nbsp;Although turkey vulture populations in Central and South America generally remain in a single location throughout the year, North American subspecies make lengthy migrations.

Baleen plates are strong and flexible; they are made of a protein similar to human fingernails.  Baleen plates are broad at the base (gumline) and taper into a fringe which forms a curtain or mat inside the whale's mouth. Baleen whales strain huge volumes of ocean water through their baleen plates to capture food: tons of krill, other zooplankton, crustaceans, and small fish.The smallest of the rorqual whales (and the second-smallest baleen whale), the minke whale is also the most abundant. Two species are now recognised, the northern hemisphere minke whale (the subject of this species page) and the southern hemisphere Antarctic minke whale (Balaenoptera bonaerensis). Minke whales are slim in shape, with a pointed dolphin-like head, bearing a double blow-hole. The smooth skin is dark grey above, while the belly and undersides of the flippers are white, and there is often a white band on the flipper. When seen at close quarters, minke whales have variable smoky patterns which have been used to photo-identify individuals.Minke whales feed on fish and various invertebrates; like all baleen whales they filter their food from the water using their baleen plates like sieves. Although largely a solitary species, when feeding minke whales can often be seen in pairs, and on particularly good feeding grounds up to a hundred individuals may congregate. A number of feeding techniques have been observed, including trapping shoals of fish against the surface of the water. After a ten month gestation period, births occur in mid-winter, at birth the calf measures up to 2.8 metres in length. It will be weaned at four months of age, and will stay with its mother for up to two years, becoming sexually mature at seven years of age. Minke whales have an average life span of around 50 years.

They are identifiable by a narrow, pointy snout, and most seen in North American waters have a white stripe on the back of each flipper. Minkes are relatively common in coastal waters, where they feed on marine crustaceans and fish. They may also become the prey of killer whales. During spring and summer minkes generally migrate north through coastal waters. In fall and winter they go south, taking an offshore route. They tend to occur in small groups of two or three. Mature females can calve every year, after a gestation of about 10 months. Calves are born at any time of the year, but mostly in January and June.

The courtship of D. plexippus is fairly simple and less dependent on chemical pheromones in comparison with other species in its genus.  Courtship is composed of two distinct stages, the aerial phase and the ground phase.  During the aerial phase, the male pursues, nudges, and eventually takes down the female.  Copulation occurs during the ground phase and involves the transfer of a spermatophore from the male to female.

Australia has the most problems with European rabbits, due to the lack of natural predators there.&nbsp; Although world-wide this species is frequently eradicated as a populous pest, it is listed as Near Threatened on the IUCN red list, because the designation is based on the population in its native range, which is declining due to &quot;disease, habitat loss and human-induced mortality&quot; (Smith and Boyer 2008).&nbsp; Its decline in its native range has caused subsequent decline of its highly dependent predators, the Iberian lynx and the Spanish Imperial eagle.&nbsp;\r\n\r\nThe European rabbit is well known for digging networks of burrows, called warrens, where it spends most of its time when not feeding. Unlike the related hares (Lepus spp.), rabbits are altricial, the young being born blind and furless, in a fur-lined nest in the warren, and they are totally dependent upon their mother. Much of the modern research into wild rabbit behaviour was carried out in the 1960s by two research centres. One was the naturalist Ronald Lockley, who maintained a number of large enclosures for wild rabbit colonies, with observation facilities, in Orielton, Pembrokeshire. Apart from publishing a number of scientific papers, he popularised his finding in a book The Private Life of the Rabbit, which is credited by Richard Adams as having played a key role in his gaining &quot;a knowledge of rabbits and their ways&quot; that was espoused in the novel Watership Down. The other group was the Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organisation (CSIRO) in Australia, where Mykytowycz and Myers performed numerous studies of the social behaviour of wild rabbits. Since the onset of Myxomatosis, which is a disease caused by the Myxoma virus and the decline of the significance of the rabbit as an agricultural pest, few large-scale studies have been performed and many aspects of rabbit behaviour are still poorly understood (Wikipedia 16 October 2013).", "Global Range: Apparently native throughout southwestern Europe and northwestern Africa.

The plumage ranges from all white (some old males) to white with many dark bars and spots (particularly in females and immatures). \r\n\r\nThis is a bird of the open Arctic tundra of both the New World and Old World. Snowy Owls nest on the ground and feed mainly on lemmings, which they hunt both day and night (other mammals and birds are also eaten, as well as some fish and carrion). In winter, there is some movement south and individuals are seen at least  irregularly south to the northern United States (and even, rarely, the Gulf Coast), Iceland, the British Isles, northern continental Europe, central Russia, northern China, and Sakhalin. These wandering winter birds are generally seen in open country such as prairie, marshes, fields, pastures, and sandy beaches.  In years when lemming populations crash, many Snowy Owls move south to the northern tier of states in the United States and some go much farther. These wandering birds (usually heavily barred younger birds) often perch on the ground, low stumps, or buildings. \r\n\r\nIn many Arctic regions, Snowy Owls breed mainly in years when lemmings are abundant and fail to nest at all when lemmings are scarce. Although Snowy Owls are silent off the breeding grounds, males defend their breeding territories with deep hooting in early spring. A courting male flies with deep, slow wingbeats, often with a lemming in his bill; reaching the female, he leans forward and partly raises his wings. The nest site is typically a mound or ridge in hilly country or a hummock in low-lying areas. It is always in very open tundra with high visibility. The same site may be used for several years. The nest (which is built by the female) is a simple depression in the tundra with no lining added.  Clutch size is highly variable (3 to 11 eggs) and correlated with prey abundance. The eggs are whitish, but become stained in the nest. The female incubates the eggs for 31 to 33 days and the male brings food to the incubating female. Egg hatch is not synchronized, so the female cares for her first young while still incubating her last eggs.  The female remains with the young and the male brings her food, which the female feeds them.

However, home ranges overlap, and groups, numbering between 3 and 20 individuals, may come into contact. In such circumstances females will attempt to intimidate the opposing group by staring, and occasionally will fight briefly before retreating to the centre of the range (2).&nbsp;Following increased scent marking by females (5), mating takes place in a short period in mid April, resulting in synchronous births four months later in August and September (2). The purpose of this careful timing is to ensure that the young are weaned just as fruit becomes plentiful. Males compete for access to females, daubing their tails with scent from their wrist glands and wafting this pungent odour towards their opponent. These stink fights are commonly sufficient to establish rank, but fights can occur. Males might move between groups during the mating season to impregnate as many females as possible.

This is a common bird of woodlands, farmland, and suburbs across most of  North America, breeding from British Columbia and southern Quebec in Canada south to southern Mexico, with a southward contraction of this range in the winter. \r\n\r\nBrown-headed Cowbirds are well known as \"brood parasites\", sneaking their eggs into the nests of birds of other species to be reared by adoptive \"host\" parents (which are often much smaller than them). During the breeding season, Brown-headed Cowbirds tend to engage in courtship and nest parasitism mainly in the morning and to feed in the afternoon. A single female may travel more than 6 km through woodlands to lay as many as several dozen eggs in a breeding season. Providing bird food in spring around the edges of large woodlands unintentionally facilitates brood parasitism by cowbirds, which can greatly reproduce the reproductive output of their hosts. \r\n\r\nIn the breeding season, males display by fluffing up their body feathers, partly speading their wings and tail, and bowing deeply while singing. Groups of males sometimes perch together, singing and displaying. The male's song is a squeaky gurgle. \r\n\r\nBrown-headed Cowbird eggs are whitish with brown and gray spots concentrated at the larger end and are often easily recognized because they look different and larger than the other eggs in a host nest. A female may lay nearly an egg per day for several weeks, up to 40 in a breeding season (rarely as many as 70 or more). A female will often remove a host egg before adding one of her own.  Brown-headed Cowbird eggs have been found in the nests of more than 220 species and over 140 of these are known to have successfully reared young cowbirds. Fed by their host parents, cowbird nestlings develop rapidly, usually leaving the nest after  about 10 or 11 days.\r\n\r\nThe diet of the Brown-headed Cowbird consists mainly of seeds and insects (seeds account for around half the diet during the breeding season, but more than 90% in the winter). Centuries ago, these birds probably followed bison herds on the Great Plains,  as they often follow cattle and horses across North America today, feeding on insects flushed from the grass. This dramatic range expansion over the past century or two has negatively impacted a number of parasatized songbird species, some quite seriously.\r\n\r\n(Kaufman 1996; AOU 1998; Dunn and Alderfer 2011)\r\n", "Global Range: Breeding range extends from southeast Alaska, northern British Columbia, and southern Mackenzie to Newfoundland, and south to central Mexico, southern Texas, Gulf Coast, and southern Florida (AOU 1983, Lowther 1993).

This species historically occurred in the Great Plains west of the Mississippi River and often was associated with bison that stirred up insects and uncovered seeds. In the 1700s and 1800s, European settlers fragmented the once unbroken expanse of eastern deciduous forest, leading to cowbird expansion throughout the eastern United States and Canada (Mayfield 1965, 1977). Fragmentation of forests and cowbird expansion occurred more recently in the western United States (Verner and Ritter 1983)."], "py/object": "__main__.Species"}, {"thumbs_list": ["http://media.eol.org/content/2011/08/04/08/52233_98_68.jpg", "http://media.eol.org/content/2013/02/14/16/06734_98_68.jpg"], "common_name": "pronghorn", "scientific_name": "Antilocapra americana (Ord, 1815)", "images_list": ["http://media.eol.org/content/2011/08/04/08/52233_orig.jpg", "http://media.eol.org/content/2013/02/14/16/06734_orig.jpg"], "web_url": "http://www.eol.org/pages/328661", "text_list": ["Pronghorn are endemic to North America, and are the only living members of the family Antilocapridae.

The narrow head and strongly hooked beak give rise to this turtle's common name (6), while the imbricate nature of the (overlapping) scutes give rise to the Latin species name of 'imbricata' (7).", "Habitat and Ecology HabitatsHawksbills nest on insular and mainland sandy beaches throughout the tropics and subtropics. They are highly migratory and use a wide range of broadly separated localities and habitats during their lifetimes (for review see Witzell 1983). Available data indicate that newly emerged hatchlings enter the sea and are carried by offshore currents into major gyre systems where they remain until reaching a carapace length of some 20 to 30 cm. At that point they recruit into a neritic developmental foraging habitat that may comprise coral reefs or other hard bottom habitats, sea grass, algal beds, or mangrove bays and creeks (Musick and Limpus 1997) or mud flats (R. von Brandis unpubl. data). As they increase in size, immature Hawksbills typically inhabit a series of developmental habitats, with some tendency for larger turtles to inhabit deeper sites (van Dam and Diez 1997, Bowen et al. 2007). Once sexually mature, they undertake breeding migrations between foraging grounds and breeding areas at intervals of several years (Witzell 1983, Dobbs et al. 1999, Mortimer and Bresson 1999). Global population genetic studies have demonstrated the tendency of female sea turtles to return to breed at their natal rookery (Bowen and Karl 1997), even though as juveniles they may have foraged at developmental habitats located hundreds or thousands of kilometers from the natal beach. While Hawksbills undertake long migrations, some portion of immature animals may settle into foraging habitats near their beaches of origin (Bowen et al. 2007).Roles in the Ecosystem  Like other species of sea turtles, Hawksbills contribute to marine and coastal food webs and transport nutrients within the oceans (Bouchard and Bjorndal 2000). Hawksbills are important components of healthy coral reef ecosystems and are primarily spongivorous in the Caribbean (Meylan 1988), but more omnivorous in the Indo-Pacific (review by Bjorndal 1997).

Their upper lip and nose is elongated into a trunk that serves multiple functions, from a dextrous fifth limb to a sound producer and amplifier, and an important method of touch between individuals (2). The African elephant trunk ends in two opposing processes (or lips), which differs from that of the Asian elephant (Elephas maximus), whose trunk ends in a single process (7). A further characteristic feature are the elephant's tusks, which are large modified upper incisors that continue to grow throughout their lifetime; in both sexes of the African elephant these are curved forward (7).", "Elephant society is highly complex and arranged around family units composed of groups of closely related females and their calves. Each family unit contains around ten individuals (6), led by an old female known as the 'matriarch' (2). Family units often join up with other bands of females forming 'kinship groups' or 'bond groups', and larger herds may number well over a hundred individuals (7). Male elephants leave their natal group at puberty and tend to form much more fluid alliances with other males. Elephants are extremely long-lived and although females may reach sexual maturity at ten years old they are at their most fertile between 25 and 45 (2). There is no distinct breeding season, although birth peaks in certain areas may relate to the local rainfall patterns (9). Calves are born after an exceptionally long gestation period of nearly two years, and continue to be dependent on their mother for several years (2). They are also cared for by other females in the group, especially by young females known as 'allomothers' (2). The social bonds between elephants are very strong and if faced with danger they will form a protective circle around the young calves, with the adults facing outwards and the matriarch adopting a threatening pose or even charging the intruder (2). Elephants care for their wounded and also show recognition of, and particular interest in, elephant bones (10).&nbsp;Elephant groups will spend the day wandering their home range in search of food and water (2). An adult elephant requires 160 kilograms of food a day; using their highly mobile trunk they pluck at grasses and leaves or tear at branches and bark with their tusks, which can cause enormous damage (7). Elephants can communicate over large distances and use some vocalisations that are below the range of human hearing (11)."], "py/object": "__main__.Species"}, {"thumbs_list": ["http://media.eol.org/content/2014/12/22/20/37655_98_68.jpg", "http://media.eol.org/content/2013/02/03/12/16709_98_68.jpg"], "common_name": "spring peeper", "scientific_name": "Pseudacris crucifer (Wied-Neuwied, 1838)", "images_list": ["http://media.eol.org/content/2014/12/22/20/37655_orig.jpg", "http://media.eol.org/content/2013/02/03/12/16709_orig.jpg"], "web_url": "http://www.eol.org/pages/1048371", "text_list": ["Pseudacris crucifer is a small species of frog, ranging from .75 of an inch to 1.25 inches in total length.

The species was formally described by George Shaw in1805, but specimens were still very rare in museum collections until the late 1830s. John Gould (1804\u20131881), whilst collecting and exploring in Australia from 1838\u20131840, was clearly captivated by these small parrots, referring to them as \u2018the most animated, cheerful little creatures you can possibly imagine\u2019.He collected a number of specimens, and in 1840 published the first detailed account of budgerigar behaviour in his great work Birds of Australia, where he also changed the scientific name in recognition of the species\u2019 unique characteristics. However, Gould is best remembered by budgerigar enthusiasts for successfully importing the first live birds to Britain, also in 1840. Gould is also remembered as the ornithologist who described the famous finches of the Galapagos discovered by Charles Darwin during the voyage of the Beagle (1831\u20131836).Other namesThe common name budgerigar comes from one of the native aboriginal names, recorded by Gould as \u2018Betcherrygah\u2019, which is widely thought to mean \u2018good eating\u2019.

This widely distributed North American species breeds from California, Colorado, Iowa, and Ontario south to the Bahamas, Greater Antilles, and southern Mexico. They have also been introduced and established in the Hawaiian Islands (main islands from Kauai eastward) and in Bermuda. Northern Mockingbirds are found in a variety of open and semi-open situations, especially in scrub, thickets, and gardens and in towns and cities and around cultivated areas.\r\n \r\nNorthern Mockingbirds sing a mix of original and imitative phrases, each repeated several times. They may imitate the songs of a wide variety of other birds' songs and calls, sometimes in rapid succession, as well as other sounds. They often sing at night as well as during the day. Both sexes sing in fall as they claim feeding territories. The often heard call is a loud, sharp check.\r\n\r\nThe diet of the Northern Mockingbird consists mostly of insects and berries. The annual diet is around half insects and other arthropods and half berries and other fruits, but the diet is heavy on insects in late spring and summer and in fruits in fall and winter. \r\n\r\nNesting begins early in the year, by late winter in the southern United States. The male sings to defend his territory and attract a mate, often leaping a meter in the air and flapping his wings while singing. Early courtship involves the male and female chasing each other around the male's territory. The nest is placed in a dense tree or shrub, typically one to three meters above the ground, but sometimes lower or higher (rarely up to 18 m). The nest has a bulky foundation of twigs supporting an open cup of weeds, grass, and leaves lined with fine material such as rootlets, moss, animal hair, and plant down. The male builds most of the foundation and the female adds most of the lining. Typical clutch size is 3 to 4 eggs (sometimes as few as 2 or as many as 6). Egg color ranges from greenish to bluish gray, with blotches of brown usually concentrated at the larger end. Eggs are incubated (by the female alone) for 12 to 13 days. Both parents feed the nestlings, which leave the nest around 12 days after hatching but are not able to fly well for another week or so. Northern Mockingbirds may produce two to three clutches per year.\r\n \r\nNorthern Mockingbirds were often captured for sale as pets from the late 1700s to the early 1900s and possibly as a result became scarce along much of the northern edge of their range. With the end of the cagebird trade, the Northern Mockingbird became more common in many areas. In recent decades, this species has expanded its range northward, especially in the northeast, possibly as a consequence of the widespread planting of multiflora rose (an excellent source of both food and nesting sites) and a changing climate.\r\n\r\n(Kaufman 1996; AOU 1998; Dunn and Alderfer 2011)\r\n", "Northern mockingbirds are distributed throughout North America, including Canada and Mexico.  In fact, sightings have been reported as far off the coast as Hawaii (where they were introduced).  However, northern mockingbirds are most commonly found in the southern regions of the United States and are most often sighted in Texas and Southern Florida.

Most horses are domesticated, but there are some feral populations in isolated pockets around the world.\r\n\r\nHorses are medium to large mammals, with long heads and necks with a mane. Their legs are slender and end in a single toe, protected by a horny hoof. They have long, slender tails, either ending in a tuft, or entirely covered in flowing hair. They are adapted to generally open terrain, from plains and savannas, to mountains or deserts. Equines are one of only two mammals (the other is the human) capable of producing copious sweat perspiration for thermoregulatory cooling, enabling fast running over long distances.\r\n\r\nHorses are herbivores, and feed predominantly on tough, fibrous food, such as grasses and sedges. When in need, they will also eat other vegetable matter, such as leaves, fruits, or bark, but are normally grazers, not browsers. Unlike ruminants, with their complex stomachs, equines break down cellulose in the \"hindgut\" or caecum, a part of the colon.\r\n\r\nEquus caballus sylvaticus, the Forest or Diluvian Horse, appears to be the ancestor of the modern draft and heavyweight breeds; these horses were slow-moving and stoutly built, with coarse, thick coats, manes, and tails. Equus caballus gmelini Antonius, the Tarpan horse, from eastern Europe and the steppes of southern Russia, had a smaller, lighter build, but was hardy, strong and speedy; many pony and light horse breeds are believed to have evolved from this lineage. Equus caballus przewalskii prsewalskii Poliakov, the Asiatic horse, was discovered in the wild in Mongolia in 1879, and a few populations still live in the wild in eastern Asia, as well as in zoos. Although the Asiatic horse, which is hardy, cold-resistant and dun with darker mane and tail, is considered to be ancestral to many breeds, it has a different chromosome number (33, vs. the 32 found in modern horse breeds). Differing lineages or combinations of the three original subspecies in turn yielded four general types of ponies and horses from which all modern breeds derive.\r\n\r\nThe horse was first domesticated 5,000 to 6,000 years ago, perhaps earlier. Horses appear to have been domesticated in conjunction with the evolution of agriculture. From this start, horse breeds were developed and used in warfare and for transportation.\r\n\r\n(McBane 2005, Wikipedia 2012.)", "Hooves resist cracking: horse    &nbsp;              The hooves of horses resist cracking by having braided filaments of keratin in horizontal sheets punctuated vertically by thin, hollow tubes."], "py/object": "__main__.Species"}, {"thumbs_list": ["http://media.eol.org/content/2012/06/13/01/33972_98_68.jpg", "http://media.eol.org/content/2012/08/30/22/12403_98_68.jpg"], "common_name": "Common seal", "scientific_name": "Phoca vitulina Linnaeus, 1758", "images_list": ["http://media.eol.org/content/2012/06/13/01/33972_orig.jpg", "http://media.eol.org/content/2012/08/30/22/12403_orig.jpg"], "web_url": "http://www.eol.org/pages/328629", "text_list": ["This species is gregarious; on land it forms groups to breed, rest and moult that are generally small but may number up to 1,000 individuals (5). Common seals feed mainly on a variety of fish, but squids, whelks, crabs and mussels are also taken. Juveniles feed on shrimps before progressing to the adult diet (2). When feeding, common seals travel up to 50 kilometres from haul-out sites to feed and may stay out at sea for days. They can dive for up to 10 minutes, and reach depths of 50 metres or more (3).&nbsp;With regards to breeding, there is apparently no social organisation, but females often give birth in small groups (7). Females give birth to a single pup at the end of June to early July (8). The pups weigh 11 to 12 kilograms at birth and are able to swim and crawl almost immediately (2). Pups are nursed for about four weeks, after which they may disperse over long distances (5). Around the time that the pup is weaned, females become receptive and copulation occurs. Males frequently engage in underwater displays and fights around this time and can lose up to 25 percent of their body weight (5).", "Harbor Seals live near coastlines and eat a highly varied seafood diet, depending on what is available. They can dive as deep as 450 m and stay under for almost half an hour, but six-minute dives to depths of 30-100 m are more usual. Females usually have one pup a year, and two weeks after the pup is born, mate again. The fertilized egg stays dormant in the uterus for up to three months before it implants in the uterine wall and begins to grow. This is called delayed implantation. Total gestation, including the period of delay, lasts 8-9 months. Instead of being born with the white coat typical of most seals in the family Phocidae, the pups often molt before birth, shedding the very soft white or pale gray coat called a lanugo while they are still in the uterus. Like dogs, Harbor Seals can suffer from heartworm. The disease has been found in North American and European populations.Links:Mammal Species of the World"], "py/object": "__main__.Species"}, {"thumbs_list": ["http://media.eol.org/content/2011/11/02/00/03836_98_68.jpg", "http://media.eol.org/content/2014/10/16/01/84179_98_68.jpg"], "common_name": "American moose", "scientific_name": "Alces americanus (Clinton, 1822)", "images_list": ["http://media.eol.org/content/2011/11/02/00/03836_orig.jpg", "http://media.eol.org/content/2014/10/16/01/84179_orig.jpg"], "web_url": "http://www.eol.org/pages/2921075", "text_list": ["Moose are found throughout northern North America.

The range has been expanding westward in recent decades. Two forms (both appearing all black at a distance) were at one time recognized as distinct species: The \"Bronzed Grackle\", which occurs in most of New England and west of the Appalachians, has a bronze back, blue head, and purple tail; the smaller \"Purple Grackle\", found east of the Appalachians, has a narrow bill, purple head, bottle green back, and purple tail. Birds from the mid-Atlantic states show variable head color and a purplish back with iridescent bands of variable color.

Outside the breeding season, they usually forage in flocks. \r\n\r\nCommon Grackles often nest in small colonies of 10 to 30 pairs  (sometimes as many as 100 or more) and several males may perch in adjacent treetops to sing their creaking, grating songs. In courtship, the male fluffs out his body feathers, partly spreads his wings and tail, and delivers a short scraping song; he also postures with his bill pointing straight up. The nest is typically built in dense vegetation less than 6 m above the ground. The nest, which is built by the female, is a bulky open cup of weeds, grass, and twigs, usually with some mud added, and the inside is lined with fine grass. The 4 to 5 (sometimes as few as two or as many as 6) pale blue eggs are blotched with brown. Incubation is by the female only for 12 to 14 days. Both parents feed the young, bringing them mostly insects. The young leave the nest around 16 to 20 days after hatching. \r\n\r\nCommon Grackles are present year-round across much of their range.

Painted turtles are medium-sized turtles (10 to 18 cm). Males are smaller than females; adult males average from 170 to 190 g, whereas adult females average from 260 to 330 g in some populations (Congdon et al., 1986; Ernst 1971b). In general, the shell comprises approximately 30 percent of the total wet weight of turtles of this size (Hall, 1924). \r\n\r\nPainted turtle habitat requirements include soft and muddy bottoms, basking sites, and aquatic vegetation (Sexton, 1959). Painted turtles prefer slow-moving shallow water such as ponds, marshes, ditches, prairie sloughs, spring runs, canals, and occasionally brackish tidal marshes (Conant and Collins, 1991). They frequent areas with floating surface vegetation for feeding and for cover (Sexton, 1959). These areas tend to be warmer than more open water, which is important in the early fall as temperatures begin to drop (Sexton, 1959). For winter hibernation or dormancy, painted turtles seek deeper water (Sexton, 1959). If outlying marsh areas are dry during the summer, the turtles may return to the more permanent bodies of water sooner (McAuliffe, 1978). Painted turtles sometimes inhabit stagnant and polluted water (Smith, 1956).\r\n\r\nPainted turtles are omnivorous. Depending on habitat and on age, painted turtles may consume predominantly vegetation or predominantly animal matter. Marchand (1942, cited in Mahmoud and Klicka, 1979) found in one population that juveniles consumed approximately 85 percent animal matter and 15 percent plant matter, whereas the adults were primarily herbivorous, consuming 88 percent plant matter and 12 percent insects and amphipods. \r\n\r\nPainted turtles are diurnal and usually spend their nights sleeping submerged (Ernst, 1971c). During the day, they forage in the late morning and late afternoon and bask during the rest of the day (Ernst, 1971c). Active feeding does not occur until water temperatures approach 20 degrees C, and these turtles are most active around 20.7 to 22.4 degrees C (Ernst, 1972; Ernst and Barbour, 1972; Hutchinson, 1979). Basking is most frequent in the spring, summer, and fall, but occasionally painted turtles bask during warm spells in the winter (Ernst and Barbour, 1972). \r\n\r\nMost painted turtles become dormant during the colder months but will become active during warm periods in the winter (Ernst and Barbour, 1972).", "Continent: Middle-America North-America AsiaDistribution: S Canada (Nova Scotia, New Brunswick, Quebec, Ontario, Manitoba, Saskatchewan, Alberta, British Columbia), &nbsp;USA (Georgia, Alabama, Mississippi, Louisiana, Oklahoma, Arkansas, Colorado, Wyoming, Idaho, Oregon, Washington, Montana, North Dakota, South Dakota, Nebraska, Kansas, Minnesota, Iowa, Missouri, Wisconsin, Illinois, Tennessee, Indiana, Kentucky, Michigan, Ohio, West Virginia, Virginia, South Carolina, North Carolina, Maryland, Delaware, New Jersey, Pennsylvania, Connecticut, Massachusetts, Vermont, New York, New Hampshire, Maine, scattered in W Texas, New Mexico, Arizona, Utah, introduced to Florida and California), &nbsp;Mexico (Chihuahua)&nbsp;&nbsp;introduced to the Philippine Islands, Germany, Indonesia, Spain (Rhodin et al. 2010).&nbsp;&nbsp;Type locality: Lancaster, Philadelphia, USA (designated by MITLLEMAN 1945).&nbsp;&nbsp;dorsalis: USA (Alabama, Arizona, Arkansas, Illinois, Louisiana, Mississippi, Missouri, Oklahoma, Texas); Type locality: vicinity of New Orleans, Louisiana (restricted by K.P.

For the genus Hippopotamus, see Hippopotamus (genus).The common hippopotamus (Hippopotamus amphibius), or hippo, is a large, mostly herbivorous mammal in sub-Saharan Africa, and one of only two extant species in the family Hippopotamidae, the other being the pygmy hippopotamus (Choeropsis liberiensis or Hexaprotodon liberiensis). The name comes from the ancient Greek for \"river horse\" (\u1f31\u03c0\u03c0\u03bf\u03c0\u03cc\u03c4\u03b1\u03bc\u03bf\u03c2). After the elephant and rhinoceros, the common hippopotamus is the third-largest type of land mammal and the heaviest extant artiodactyl. Despite their physical resemblance to pigs and other terrestrial even-toed ungulates, their closest living relatives are cetaceans (whales, porpoises, etc.) from which they diverged about 55 million years ago. The common ancestor of whales and hippos split from other even-toed ungulates around 60 million years ago. The earliest known hippopotamus fossils, belonging to the genus Kenyapotamus in Africa, date to around 16 million years ago.", "Despite its massive bulk, this amphibious mammal moves underwater with grace, and trots on land with surprising speed (2) (4). Indeed, the name hippopotamus means 'river horse', pertaining to this species' semi-aquatic lifestyle (7). An extremely large animal with a round, barrel-shaped body, short legs and a large, broad head. The body is a greyish to muddy-brown colour on top and a pale pink colour underneath (3) (7) (8). The broad mouth can be opened extremely wide to expose large, curved canines, used in aggressive displays (3). The eyes, ears and nostrils protrude on the top of the head, allowing the animal to remain receptive to its surroundings and breathe while otherwise almost totally submerged underwater (3) (4). The hippopotamus' virtually hairless skin is moistened by a secreted pink, oily substance that protects the skin from sunburn and drying, and perhaps infection (2) (3)."], "py/object": "__main__.Species"}, {"thumbs_list": ["http://media.eol.org/content/2014/09/17/04/86892_98_68.jpg", "http://media.eol.org/content/2012/06/13/03/03557_98_68.jpg"], "common_name": "Long-eared Owl", "scientific_name": "Asio otus (Linnaeus, 1758)", "images_list": ["http://media.eol.org/content/2014/09/17/04/86892_orig.jpg", "http://media.eol.org/content/2012/06/13/03/03557_orig.jpg"], "web_url": "http://www.eol.org/pages/915724", "text_list": ["Long-eared owls are active at night.

The nostrils are parallel (4), and the 'Roman' nose is characteristic, especially in males (7); the scientific name derives from the Greek for 'hooked-nose sea-pig' (8)."], "py/object": "__main__.Species"}, {"thumbs_list": ["http://media.eol.org/content/2013/04/02/02/95894_98_68.jpg", "http://media.eol.org/content/2012/06/13/01/33971_98_68.jpg"], "common_name": "Bohemian Waxwing", "scientific_name": "Bombycilla garrulus (Linnaeus, 1758)", "images_list": ["http://media.eol.org/content/2013/04/02/02/95894_orig.jpg", "http://media.eol.org/content/2012/06/13/01/33971_orig.jpg"], "web_url": "http://www.eol.org/pages/1050636", "text_list": ["Bohemian waxwings are native to the Nearctic and Palearctic regions.

They are also residents in Florida, where they were introduced. The majority of White-winged Doves are seasonally migratory. They overwinter in Mexico and Central America and come to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico in April to breed, departing again in September.

Leopards are found throughout Africa where there is sufficient cover and from the Arabian Peninsula through Asia to Manchuria and Korea. In the African rainforests and Sri Lanka, the Leopard is the only large predator. The black spot seen in the center of each rosette on a Jaguar's coat is typically lacking in Leopards. Melanistic Leopards (\"black panthers\"; melanistic Jaguars may also be referred to by this name) sometimes occur in several parts of Africa, but are more common in Thailand, Malaysia, and Java (Indonesia). \r\n\r\nLeopards are found in an extraordinary range of habitats. In sub-Saharan Africa, they may be found in any habitats with annual rainfall greater than 50 mm, as well as along rivers penetrating true deserts. Leopards in the Kalahari Desert can reportedly go 10 days without drinking. In deserts with temperatures reaching 70 C, Leopards can survive by seeking shelter during the day in caves, animal burrows, and dense vegetation. In Central and West Africa, Leopards occur in rainforests receiving more than 1500 mm annual rainfall. Leopards are common throughout the Indian subcontinent in savannahs, acacia grasslands, deciduous and evergreen forests, and scrub woodlands. They may occur to 5200 m elevation in the mountains of Pakistan and Kashmir. In Southeast Asia, they occur in dense primary rainforest, among other habitats. In the Russian Far East, they may be found in forested mountainous regions where the snow is less than 15 cm deep. Leopards are capable of persisting in close proximity to humans. \r\n\r\nThe diet of the Leopard is highly varied, including both large and small prey. It often consists mainly of small and medium-sized mammals (5 to 45 kg), but may range from large beetles to ungulates (hoofed mammals) several times their size. Most hunting occurs at night. Sunquist and Sunquist (2009) review the diet of Leopards as reported from different portions of their range.\r\n\r\nLike other felids (i.e., members of the cat family), Leopards commonly kill their prey with a bite to the throat, although smaller prey may be dispatched with a bite to the nape or back of the head. Large prey items may be dragged up into a tree and cached there, especially in Africa, where carcasses may otherwise be taken over by hyenas or lions. In Sri Lanka, where the Leopard is the only large carnivore, Leopards are reportedly often seen in open areas during the day. \r\n\r\nIn the wild, mating associations last just a day or two. The gestation period is around 96 days and young are born at 400 to 600 g. Litter size is typically one to three young (usually two, maximum six). Young travel with their mother starting at three to six months (when they weigh around three or four kg) and begin to eat meat. Permanent canines are emerged at around seven to eight months and the young are typically independent by 12 to 18 months (athough sometimes significantly later). Sexual maturity is reached at two to three years of age. \r\n\r\nIn some parts of their range, Leopards are endangered, whereas in other places they are considered pests. \r\n\r\n(Estes 1991; Sunquist and Sunquist 2009)", "The Hindu Kush alpine meadow has an expanse of some 10,900 square miles, situated in northeastern Afghanistan and northern Pakistan.

Throughout most of its range from northern California to Alaska, Sitka spruce is associated with western hemlock (Tsuga heterophylla) in dense stands where growth rates are among the highest in North America. It is a valuable commercial timber species for lumber, pulp, and various specialty products, and is the State Tree of Alaska.\r\n\r\nSitka spruce grows in a narrow strip along the north Pacific coast from latitude 61\u00b0 N. in southcentral Alaska to 39\u00b0 N. in northern California. The most extensive portion of the range in both width and elevation is in southeast Alaska and northern British Columbia, where the east-west range extends for about 210 km (130 mi) to include a narrow mainland strip and the many islands of the Alexander Archipelago in Alaska and the Queen Charlotte Islands in British Columbia. In Washington, the range includes a narrow mainland strip along the Strait of Georgia, around Puget Sound, up valleys to the east, and on the Olympic Peninsula. On the west side of the Olympic Peninsula, the range broadens to include the extensive coastal plain and seaward mountain slopes. It narrows southward along the Washington and Oregon coast but extends inland for several kilometers along the major rivers. In northern California, the range is more attenuated and becomes discontinuous. A disjunct population in Mendocino County, CA, marks the southern limit of the range.\r\n\r\nSitka spruce usually grows in mixed stands, less often in pure stands. Pure stands usually occur in early successional situations and as tidewater stands influenced by salt spray. Sitka spruce is commonly associated with western hemlock throughout most of its range. Toward the south, other conifer associates include Douglas-fir (Pseudotsuga menziesii), Port-Orford-cedar (Chamaecyparis lawsoniana), western white pine (Pinus monticola), and redwood (Sequoia sempervirens).\r\n\r\nSitka spruce is commercially harvested as pulpwood and for lumbers. High strength-to-weight ratio and resonant qualities of clear lumber are attributes that have traditionally made Sitka spruce wood valuable for specialty uses, such as sounding boards for high-quality pianos; guitar faces; ladders; construction components of experimental light aircraft; oars, planking, masts, and spars for custom-made or traditional boats; and turbine blades for wind energy conversion systems.\r\n", "Trees  to 80m; trunk to 5m diam.; crown narrowly conic.

The young are fed mostly insects. \r\n\r\nThe male sings to defend his nesting territory and actively attacks intruders. In courtship, both male and female raise their heads high and sway back and forth while singing softly. Early in the breeding season, the male often feeds the female. The female sings mainly in the spring before nesting. The nest, which is an open cup built by the female, is typically hidden in dense vegetation 1 to 3 m above the ground, sometimes higher.  The 3 to 4 (sometimes 2 or 5)  eggs (whitish to pale bluish or greenish white marked with brown, purple, and gray)  are incubated for 12 to 13 days, almost always by the female alone.  Both parents feed the young, which leave the nest around 9 to 11 days after hatching. The male may continue to feed the fledglings as the female initiates a second brood.

It is thought that southern stingrays are polyandrous, as a female was observed mating with two males in quick succession (6).  The southern stingray is ovoviviparous, a method of reproduction in which the egg develops within the female's brood chamber.  The pups hatch from their egg capsules inside the mother, and are born soon afterwards (5).

These spines are not fatal to humans, but are incredibly painful if stepped on.  The eyes are situated on top of the head of the southern stingray, along with small openings called spiracles.  The location of the spiracles enables the stingray to take in water whilst lying on the seabed, or when partially buried in sediment.

It can run 15 mph (24 kph) and probably sprints briefly at much higher speeds in pursuit of prey. Greater Roadrunners are common in scrub desert and mesquite groves, less common in chaparral and open woodland.\r\n\r\nThe diet of the Greater Roadrunner consists of insects and other arthropods, lizards, snakes, rodents, small birds, and sometimes snails. Some fruits (especially cactus fruit) and seeds are also eaten. In addition to making rapid dashes to grab a prey item with its bill, the Greater Roadrunner may leap straight up from the ground to catch insects or small birds flying over (roadrunners have been observed capturing hummingbirds this way). \r\n\r\nGreater Roadrunners may mate for life, with a pair defending its territory all year. Courtship includes chases on foot, with frequent pauses to rest. One member of the pair approaches the other with a stick or blade of grass and drops it on the ground or gives to the other bird. In other displays, the male runs away from the female with his tail and wings raised over his back and gradually lowers his wings; the male wags his tail from side to side while slowly bowing. \r\n\r\nThe nest is constructed in a dense bush, low tree, or cactus, usually around 1 to 4 m above the ground (rarely on the ground itself). The nest is a platform of sticks lined with grass, leaves, and feathers and sometimes with pieces of snakeskin or cow manure. The 3 to 5 eggs (sometimes 2 or 6) are white to pale yellowish and are incubated by both parents (but especially the male) for around 20 days. Both parents feed the young, which leave the nest after around 18 to 21 days after hatching. Although young birds may begin capturing their own food shortly after leaving the nest, they are still fed by the parents for another 30 to 40 days. \r\n\r\nGreater Roadrunners are permanent (i.e., year-round) residents across their range, but some individuals may wander considerable distances. Although the range of the Greater Roadrunner periodically expands to the north and east, it is pushed back by severe winters. This species may be in long-term decline in California.\r\n\r\nThe Greater Roadrunner, with its long tail, expressive crest, and speedy gait,  provided inspiration for a popular cartoon character who not only entertains, but also provides opportunities for meaningful discussions of the laws of physics  and literary analysis.\r\n\r\n(Kaufman 1996; AOU 1998; Dunn and Alderfer 2011)", "Greater roadrunners are primarily a species of the southwestern United States, but their full range includes other areas as well.

Trunk bark of mature trees is grey or brownish grey, dividing into flattened plates that are separated by broad shallow furrows. The bark of young trees is light gray to greenish gray and more smooth with transverse white lenticels. Alternate leaves up to 5\" long and 3&frac12;\" across occur along the smaller branches and twigs; they are obovate or orbicular-obovate in shape, while their margins are crenate-dentate and slightly undulate. The leaf tips are rounded or slightly indented, while their bases are wedge-shaped (cuneate) to rounded. The upper leaf surface is dark green and glabrous (or nearly so), while the lower surface is more pale and either glabrous or slightly hairy along the undersides of the veins. Young leaves and shoots are often sticky from a resin. The slender petioles are light green, glabrous, and up to 1\" long. Black Alder is monoecious, producing separate male (staminate) and female (pistillate) florets on the same tree. The male florets are produced in clusters of 2-5 catkins. Mature male catkins are 2-3\" long, reddish yellow, narrowly cylindrical, and drooping. Within each of these catkins, there are tiny clusters of 3-6 florets that are partially hidden by individual bractlets. Each male floret consists of a 4-lobed calyx and 4 stamens, while each bractlet is oval in shape. The female florets are produced in branching clusters of 2-5 cone-like catkins (less often, occurring as a single catkin). These catkins are initially about &frac14;\" long, but they later become &frac34;-1\" long and &frac12;\" across. Within each of these catkins, there are tiny clusters of 2-3 female florets that are partially hidden by individual bractlets. Each female floret consists of a naked ovary with a pair of tiny styles at its apex. The blooming period occurs during the spring before the leaves develop; the florets are cross-pollinated by wind. After the blooming period, the male catkins wither away, while the female catkins persist through the summer, releasing their seeds during the fall. At this time, the bractlets of the cone-like female catkins have become brown and woody; individual bractlets are narrowly oblanceolate with 4-5 short stubby lobes. Individual seeds are obovoid and flattened; their margins are not significantly winged. The female catkins usually persist on the tree through the winter. The root system is woody and branching.

They live in stable communities that may have up to 150 members, although these will usually split into smaller groups in order to forage or travel (2). Swellings on the rump advertise a female's receptivity to mating; there is no specific breeding season (5). A single offspring is born after around 8 months of gestation and will be cared for by its mother for almost 5 years (6). Bonobo society has some very marked differences to those of chimpanzees and this has fascinated researchers since their discovery. In both, males remain in their natal group whilst females disperse, but in contrast to the male-dominated chimpanzee society, females in bonobo groups develop strong relationships and males will often defer to them during feeding (2). The cooperative hunting and aggressive raids on neighbouring groups that male chimpanzees partake in have not been seen amongst bonobos and it may be that these differences are related to a more reliable and widely available food source (2). One of the other striking features of bonobo society is sex, which is commonly used for social communication in order to diffuse situations and create bonds (2). Males and females engage in these encounters with their own sex as well as the opposite sex (2).&nbsp;Bonobos spend virtually all of their time in the trees, foraging for fruit and sleeping in nests constructed in the branches; on the ground they travel by 'knuckle walking' (2). Fruit makes up a large part of the bonobo diet but they will also consume other plant materials and small vertebrates should the opportunity arise. This species appears to depend more on plant stems in its diet than chimpanzees do, perhaps again explaining the lack of aggression in bonobo groups (2).", "Together with the chimpanzee (Pan troglodytes), the bonobo is man's closest living relative (2).

Young chicks in particular rely heavily on insects during the first few weeks of life (4).&nbsp;The breeding season begins in early spring and extends until June (4). Areas known as 'booming grounds' or 'leks' are used by males as places to dance and call to attract females (4) (5). Males fight among themselves for territories on the lek, with one or two males normally emerging as dominant, and subsequently performing the majority of the mating (8). After mating, females build their nests in tall grass, laying between 4 and 15 eggs per clutch, with an average of 12, which are incubated for approximately 26 days (4) (8). The hatching period peaks from late May to early June (4) when insect populations are high, to provide nourishment for the chicks (8), and the chicks then remain with the hen for eight to ten weeks (4).

There are two subspecies recognized in North America that are primarily distinguished by range: C. s. serpentina(the common snapping turtle, which is the largest subspecies, primarily occupies the United States east of the Rockies, except for the southern portions of Texas and Florida), and C. s. osceola (the Florida snapping turtle, found in the Florida peninsula) (Conant and Collins, 1991). In this profile, studies refer to the serpentine subspecies unless otherwise noted.\r\n\r\nAdult snapping turtles are large, 20 to 37 cm in carapace length, and males attain larger sizes than females (Congdon et al., 1986; Ernst and Barbour, 1972; Galbraith et al., 1988). In a large oligotrophic lake in Ontario Canada, adult males averaged over 10 kg, whereas the females averaged 5.2 kg (Galbraith et al., 1988). In other populations, the difference in size between males and females often is less (Congdon et al., 1986; Galbraith et al., 1988; Hammer, 1969). They reach sexual maturity at approximately 200 mm in carapace length (Mosimann and Bider, 1960). The cool, short activity season in more northern areas results in slower growth rates and longer times to reach sexual maturity (Bury, 1979).\r\n\r\nThey are most often found in turbid waters with a slow current (Graves and Anderson, 1987). They spend most of their time lying on the bottom of deep pools or buried in the mud in shallow water with only their eyes and nostrils exposed. Froese (1978) observed that young snapping turtles show a preference for areas with some obstructions that may provide cover or food.\r\n\r\nSnapping turtles are omnivorous. In early spring, when limited aquatic vegetation exists in lakes and ponds, they may eat primarily animal matter; however, when aquatic vegetation becomes abundant, they become more herbivorous (Pell, 1941, cited in Graves and Anderson, 1987). Young snapping turtles are primarily carnivorous and prefer smaller streams where aquatic vegetation is less abundant (Lagler, 1943; Pell, 1941, cited in Graves and Anderson, 1987). Snapping turtles consume a wide variety of animal material including insects, crustaceans, clams, snails, earthworms, leeches, tubificid worms, freshwater sponges, fish (adults, fry, and eggs), frogs and toads, salamanders, snakes, small turtles, birds, small mammals, and carrion and plant material including various algae (Alexander, 1943; Graves and Anderson, 1987; Hammer, 1969; \ufffcPunzo, 1975). \r\n\r\nSnappers are most active at night. During the day, they occasionally leave the water to bask on shore, but basking is probably restricted by intolerance to high temperatures and by rapid loss of moisture (Ernst and Barbour, 1972).\r\n\r\nSnapping turtles usually enter hibernation by late October and emerge sometime between March and May, depending on latitude and temperature. To hibernate, they burrow into the debris or mud bottom of ponds or lakes, settle beneath logs, or retreat into muskrat burrows or lodges. Snapping turtles have been seen moving on or below the ice in midwinter. Large congregations sometimes hibernate together (Budhabatti and Moll, 1988; Ernst and Barbour, 1972).\r\n\r\nMost turtles stay primarily within the same marsh or in one general area from year to year ((Hammer, 1969; Obbard and Brooks, 1981).

They have a broad diet, feeding on a huge range of prey small enough to swallow, including insects, spiders, earwigs, earthworms, snails and slugs; they have even been observed eating young toads (2). They feed only on land and use a 'sit-and-wait' style of hunting (6). Toads are usually welcomed by gardeners, thanks to their voracious appetites and penchant for garden pests (4).&nbsp;The life cycle is similar to that of the common frog (Rana temporaria). Common toads begin to migrate to breeding ponds in autumn. The onset of cold weather stimulates hibernation, which takes place en route in abandoned rodent burrows or in leaf litter (2). Migration then recommences in spring.&nbsp;Breeding activity, which occurs between March and June (6), is often very frenzied in this species, with much competition amongst males over access to females. Males grasp females tightly prior to spawning, and there is aggressive activity amongst males who try to 'take-over' females. 'Mating-balls' may often arise, when as many as 10 males jostle for access to a single female; the female occasionally drowns or is crushed as a result (2). Successful pairs will spawn; females release a double-string of eggs, which the male fertilises by releasing his sperm simultaneously. The pair moves around whilst spawning, so that the jelly-coated strings of eggs become wrapped around vegetation. One female may produce up to 5,000 eggs, although the usual number is around 1,500 (2). The black tadpoles move away from the spawning areas a few days after hatching. The tadpoles feed on microorganisms and usually gather in groups, which, in addition to the presence of skin toxins, probably protects them further against predation. Despite this, however, they frequently become prey for diving beetles and other species that have piercing mouthparts, and so can avoid the toxins in the skin (2). It takes 8-12 weeks for tadpoles to develop, after metamorphosis the tiny toadlets occasionally emerge en masse. Sexual maturity is reached after 2-3 years (2). Common toads can live for a very long time; some captive individuals have reached 50 years of age (5).", "The common toad is surrounded by a wealth of folklore and superstition (4).

They can grow up to 45 centimetres (18&#160;in) in length and weigh more than 0.5 kilograms (1.1&#160;lb).

It may reach up to 40 cm in length and 0.68 kg in weight. The overall colouring of the body is silver but a darker blue iridescence is present over the upper half of the body. The underside is considerably paler. The body is deeper than it is wide, which improves the streamlined nature of the fish. The tail is deeply forked and has a single dorsal fin. The pelvic fins are situated slightly in front of the line of the dorsal fin. These, as well as the pectoral fins are not bony, like in many other fish, but are soft.Clupea harengus is a highly commercial marine fish and is being threatened by over-harvesting by commercial fishing fleets (Whitehead, 1985).

Unlike gannets and boobies, it does not dive from great heights, restricting its dives to less than a half-meter (1.75 feet) over the water. It is not particularly successful with this technique, catching a fish only once in every six to ten plunges.\r\nIn Mexico, Neotropic Cormorants reportedly often fish cooperatively, forming a line across swift-flowing streams and striking the surface with their wings, causing fish to flee, whereupon the cormorants dive and pursue them.", "Chile Central"], "py/object": "__main__.Species"}, {"thumbs_list": ["http://media.eol.org/content/2011/10/24/04/33420_98_68.jpg", "http://media.eol.org/content/2013/12/04/12/10350_98_68.jpg"], "common_name": "Mexican Axolotl", "scientific_name": "Ambystoma mexicanum (Shaw and Nodder, 1798)", "images_list": ["http://media.eol.org/content/2011/10/24/04/33420_orig.jpg", "http://media.eol.org/content/2013/12/04/12/10350_orig.jpg"], "web_url": "http://www.eol.org/pages/1019571", "text_list": ["This astonishing species is part of the family of 'mole salamanders', but exhibits an unusual and extreme trait known as neoteny, or paedomorphosis. This is the retention of larval stage characteristics throughout life, so axolotls usually never fully resemble an adult salamander. Unlike other amphibians, most axolotl fail to metamorphose, living permanently in water (3). Although it does develop lungs, the axolotl's most bizarre feature is its retention of its branch-like gills. These are external projections from the neck on each side of the head. Each side has three branches covered with feathery filaments which increase the surface area for gas exchange.

They have a fine, brownish coat, often with a red or auburn tinge on the crown, and mature males are known as 'silverbacks' due to the silvery-white saddle of hair extending from the back to the rump and thighs (2). Male gorillas have a larger skull crest than females and other apes, together with larger canines and a more pronounced ridge above the eyes (2).

A series of management measures and reintroductions have enabled the beaver to return to much of its former range, and there are now a number of rapidly expanding populations extending from Spain and France across central and eastern Europe to European Russia, and in Scandinavia and parts of western Finland. Free-living populations of beavers are now established or establishing in most regions of their former European range, the main exceptions to date being Portugal, Italy, the south Balkans and Great Britain (Halley and Rosell 2002, Ce\u00f1a et al. 2004).

They possess acute eyesight, with which they can locate prey, and their flesh consists primarily of 'white' muscle which provides energy for sudden bursts of activity, such as when in pursuit of their quarry (3).  The swordfish then uses its bill to stun or impale its victim, slashes it into pieces or swallows it whole (3) (5).  Swordfish feed during the day (3), primarily on squid, but also fish and occasionally crustaceans (6) (7) (8).  They undertake vertical migrations in the ocean, following the movement of many small shrimp, fish and squid that move with the changing light intensity in a (somewhat unsuccessful) attempt to avoid predators (3) (7).  Unlike some fish, swordfish are unable to maintain a body temperature higher than the temperature of the surrounding water.  Instead, they have a unique muscle and brown tissue that warms blood flowing to the brain and eyes, enabling it to tolerate the extreme cold of the ocean depths (3).&nbsp;Swordfish also undertake lengthy seasonal migrations, to temperate or cold waters in the summer where they feed, and back to warm waters in autumn for spawning (2).  Unlike tuna, which have mostly 'red' muscle which is good for endurance activities, the mostly 'white' muscle of swordfish is not suited to swimming for long periods without fatigue (3).  Therefore, swordfish undertake their long migrations by moving with prevailing currents (3).&nbsp;Spawning occurs year-round in warm equatorial waters, while in cooler regions it occurs in the spring and summer (2) (4).  The best known spawning grounds of the swordfish are found in the Mediterranean Sea, south of the Italian peninsula and Sicily (2).  Swordfish eggs have been found here from June to September, and large numbers of juveniles occur throughout the Mediterranean from November to March (2).  Fertilization is external (3), whereby a female releases millions of buoyant eggs into the water, which are then fertilised by sperm secreted by the male.  From the fertilised eggs hatch swordfish larvae.  At only four millimetres long, with a short snout, and distinct, prickly scales (4), the larvae is vastly different to the great predator it will become.  During the first year of life the larvae grow at a phenomenal rate, reaching a length of 90 centimetres (3).  Female swordfish are thought to reach maturity at around 150 centimetres; whereas males are thought to mature at much smaller sizes, perhaps at around 100 centimetres (3).", "This fast-swimming predator gets its name from its extremely long, flat, sword-like bill, which is used to impale or slash its prey.  The swordfish, the only living member of the family Xiphiidae (3), has a long, cylindrical blackish-brown body that gradually fades to light-brown on the underside (2).  The body tapers to large anal fins, which along with the high dorsal fin enable efficient cruising.  Adult swordfish are scaleless and possess no teeth; swordfish less than one meter in length have small spines on the body and fine, file-like teeth (2).

Although Great Gray Owls are most active at dawn, at dusk, and at night, they hunt during daylight in summer (and in winter if food-stressed), although still generally near dawn or dusk.

These owls can detect prey under snow by sound and can plunge and  break through snow crust hard enough to support 80 kg and as deep as 45 cm.  Small mammals are swallowed whole and larger prey are pulled  apart.  Abandoned nests of other large bird such as Goshawks, Ravens, or Ospreys 10 to 50 feet above the ground are the most common nest sites, although these owls may sometimes nest on top of broken tree trunks and, rarely, on the ground; nests may be reused for several years. Typical clutch size is 2 to 5 eggs (clutch size may be larger in years with abundant food). Incubation (for 28 to 36 days) is by the female only, but the male brings food to the incubating female on nest. The female broods young for their first 2 to 3 weeks. In some areas, the adult female departs after young fledge while the male remains and feeds them for up to 3 months. In some winters, large numbers of Great Gray Owls may move south or southeast into eastern Canada and the extreme northeastern United States in North America and northern Germany and Ukraine in Europe (apparently in response to a sudden drop of rodent population).

The forest buffalo, due  to its more restricted habitat, forms small groups of up to 12 animals, consisting of related females and their offspring and one or more males (2).  Males not belonging to a herd are solitary, or form bachelor herds (2).  Living in a herd has its advantages; information can be shared regarding the best places to feed, and it offers increased protection against predators (6).  Bonds between females in a herd are strong (2), and if one is attacked by a predator such as a lion, the rest of the herd will respond to its bellowing distress calls and rush to its defence.  A herd of buffalo are easily capable of driving away a whole pride of lions to protect a herd member (5).   Living in large herds is not as important for the forest buffalo as they live in a habitat that does not suit carnivores, such as the lion, and they can easily retreat into cover if required (2).&nbsp;African buffalos spend most of their day lying in the shade to escape the heat.  They can often be found drinking water in the early morning and late afternoon, and most feeding takes place during the cooler night (3).  The African buffalo grazes extensively on fresh grass, turning only to herbs, shrubs and trees when there is a deficiency of grass (5).  Their dietary habits are responsible for opening up areas of long grassland for other species with more selective feeding habits, and thus they play an important ecological role in the savannas of sub-Saharan Africa (5).&nbsp;March to May is the primary period of mating in the African buffalo, resulting in a pregnancy of about 11 months (2), with calves born from January to April (5).

Although the diet comprises mainly grass, it also includes aquatic vegetation, such a water hyacinths, as well as other plants, grain, and sometimes fruits (2) (3) (4). When alarmed, the capybara is capable of running swiftly over land, and often dives into water to escape (2) (4) (6). A strong swimmer, it is able to stay underwater for up to five minutes at a time (3) (6). The species is normally active morning and evening, resting during the heat of the day, but has apparently become nocturnal in areas where it is persecuted by humans (2) (4).&nbsp;A social species, the capybara is typically found in family groups of around 10 to 30 individuals, comprising a dominant male, one or more females (which are often related), young of various ages, and one or more subordinate males. Most solitary individuals are male. Group size may depend on habitat, and in the dry season several groups may gather around dwindling pools, forming temporary aggregations of up to 100 or more animals. However, when the wet season returns, these aggregations split into the original groups that formed them (3) (5) (8). All adults in a group help defend the territory against intruders, and regularly scent mark the area using secretions from anal scent glands. These secretions may also be used for individual recognition, as the proportions of chemicals they contain differ between individual capybaras (3) (8).&nbsp;Capybaras mate in the water (3) (6). The female usually gives birth to a single litter each year (4) (6), at the end of the rainy season, after a gestation period of around 150 days (3) (8). Usually, up to eight young are born, and are highly developed at birth, able to follow the female and even eat grass within the first week of life (3) (4) (5). Weaning takes place at around 16 weeks (4), although milk is a relatively minor part of the infant's diet compared to grass (5). All young within the group tend to stay together in a cr\u00e8che, and may suckle from any nursing female (3) (8).

Before the latter half of the nineteenth century, the Passenger Pigeon was the most numerous species of bird in North America, if not the world. Between 3 and 5 billion Passenger Pigeons once inhabited the eastern United States and southern Canada. During the breeding season, massive flocks of Passenger Pigeons gathered to breed at a handful of locations in New England, the Mid-Atlantic region, the Ohio River valley, and the lower Great Lakes. Passenger Pigeon flocks rarely returned to the same breeding location more than once every several years because their breeding success was tied to long-term cycles of food abundance in that region. After the breeding season, Passenger Pigeon flocks wandered widely across eastern North America, being found wherever food was abundant. Flocks sometimes strayed as far afield as arctic Canada, central Mexico, and Cuba. Passenger Pigeon flocks required large tracts of old-growth deciduous forest in which to nest and feed. This species often did significant damage to the places it visited: Early naturalists recorded Passenger Pigeon flocks uprooting trees with their massive weight and smothering the undergrowth with a layer of droppings several inches thick. Passenger Pigeon flocks ate massive quantities of seeds and tree nuts, including acorns, chestnuts, and beechnuts. Passenger Pigeon flocks hundreds of miles long and several miles wide might have been observed travelling from one feeding site to another. However, as European Americans moved west during the nineteenth century, Passenger Pigeons and their habitat began to be exploited.

In the latter half of the nineteenth century, Passenger Pigeon populations crashed, and the species never recovered.

Populations as little as five kilometres apart are as genetically distinct as separate species, a consequence of the Banggai cardinalfish's highly limited dispersal capability, the strong currents and deep channels between the islands preventing interaction with populations at other sites (4) (5) (6).&nbsp;Banggai cardinalfish live in small groups of usually between 1 and 6 individuals, though a group of 500 has been recorded (1).  Reproduction in the Banggai cardinalfish begins with the female choosing a male; the pair then separate from the group and establish a territory, aggressively defending it from other fish that come too close. The female then initiates an unusual courtship ritual, swimming alongside the male, bodies touching, and making a trembling motion. This behaviour occurs repeatedly on both sides, with the only signs of the male's receptivity being a darkening of the lower jaw and an occasional opening of the mouth (7). After several hours of this behaviour, the female spawns a mass of up to 75 large eggs (a very small number for a marine fish). These are quickly swallowed by the male, and brooded in a special pouch inside the mouth (2). The eggs take about 20 days to hatch, after which, the newly hatched embryos continue to develop in the male's mouth pouch. After a further 10 days, when the young have reached around five to six millimetres in length, they are released (1). During the 30-day brooding period the male does not eat, and attends to the brood by frequently turning the eggs and expelling dead eggs and embryos. Once the brood are released, the male does not interact with them anymore (7). The small juveniles are most commonly found sheltering around sea anemones for protection. However, older juveniles and adults are more commonly found around branching corals and sea urchins (2) (8).&nbsp;The Banggai cardinalfish feeds principally upon tiny planktonic crustaceans, with copepods, in particular, making up about 80 percent of the diet. Nevertheless, this species is an opportunistic feeder, and will take a variety of small organisms from the water column and the seabed, including marine worms, molluscs and fish larvae. In addition, it plays an important role in its environment by preying on the larval stages of coral reef fishes' parasites (9). The Banggai cardinalfish is preyed upon by various species, such as the crocodile-fish (Cymbacephalus beauforti), various lion-fish species (genus Pterois) and the grouper (Epinephelus merra) (1).

Similar habitats are utilized during the winter, although this species may also be found further inland in flooded fields at that time of year. Gull-billed Terns primarily eat small aquatic animals, including insects, small fish, and crustaceans. Gull-billed Terns may be observed flying above beaches and near-shore waters while catching prey.

These carnivores are reported to have been mainly solitary and nocturnal (4), although small groups probably consisting of a mother and her offspring have been reported (3). Due to conflicting reports, there is some controversy as to whether breeding occurred more often in the summer or winter. Litters of up to four young were possible due to the four teats within the female's backwards-opening pouch (3). Young remained in the pouch for around four months (7) and then were probably left in a den whilst the mother went on hunting forays; the young may have joined her on these trips when they were older (2).&nbsp;Thylacines were carnivorous and are likely to have preyed upon kangaroos, small rodents and birds (4). Some reports suggest that these mammals hunted by pursuing their prey over great distances until it tired (3). Thylacines became notorious for killing sheep once European settlers began to farm, a factor that was at the forefront of their persecution. The thylacine is reported to have a fairly stiff gait, but is also believed to have been an agile animal and had been seen standing on its hind legs, supported by its tail in a manner resembling a kangaroo (3).", "The thylacine was the largest marsupial carnivore but it is now widely believed to be extinct (1). Despite similarities with canids such as the wolf, the thylacine was extremely distinctive, and the canine appearance was offset by the tapered hindquaters, relatively short legs and broad-based tail (2), which cannot be wagged from side-to-side (7). The short, coarse fur was a dirty yellow-brown with 13 to 19 transverse brown stripes running from the upper back to the base of the tail (3); animals from highland areas had a richer cinnamon-brown coat (7). There were lighter patches of fur (3) surrounding the eyes and near the erect, rounded ears (4). The belly was cream coloured, females carried a backwards-opening pouch (3), and males possessed a pseudo pouch in the form of a fold of skin that protected the testes when moving quickly through low bushland (7). The thylacine was renowned for its ability to open its jaw remarkably wide; whilst it is highly unlikely that this yawn was as wide as is sometimes quoted (180\u00b0), the gape was still the widest of any mammal (3), and is surpassed only by that of the snake (7). This species is a classic example of 'convergent evolution'; it is a marsupial mammal that closely resembles the placental canids, especially the wolf from which one of its common names is derived, due to the similarities in their way of life (5)."], "py/object": "__main__.Species"}, {"thumbs_list": ["http://media.eol.org/content/2013/02/26/05/26683_98_68.jpg", "http://media.eol.org/content/2013/02/26/05/23492_98_68.jpg"], "common_name": "purple threeawn", "scientific_name": "Aristida purpurea Nutt.", "images_list": ["http://media.eol.org/content/2013/02/26/05/26683_orig.jpg", "http://media.eol.org/content/2013/02/26/05/23492_orig.jpg"], "web_url": "http://www.eol.org/pages/1114763", "text_list": ["This species can be found across the western two thirds of the United States, southern Canada and parts of northern Mexico.", "Perennials, Terrestrial, not aquatic, Stems nodes swollen or brittle, Stems erect or ascending, Stems caespitose, tufted, or clustered, Stems terete, round in cross section, or polygonal, Stems branching above base or distally at nodes, Stem internodes solid or spongy, Stems with inflorescence less than 1 m tall, Stems, culms, or scapes exceeding basal leaves, Leaves mostly basal, b elow middle of stem, Leaves mostly  cauline, Leaves conspicuously 2-ranked, distichous, Leaves sheathing at base, Leaf sheath mostly open, or loose, Leaf sheath smooth, glabrous, Leaf sheath hairy, hispid or prickly, Leaf sheath and blade differentiated, Leaf blades linear, Leaf blades very narrow or filiform, less than 2 mm wide, Leaf blade margins folded, involute, or conduplicate, Leaf blades mostly glabrous, Ligule present, Ligule a fringe of hairs, Inflorescence terminal, Inflorescence  a contracted panicle, narrowly paniculate, branches appressed or ascending, Inflorescence solitary, with 1 spike, fascicle, glomerule, head, or cluster per stem or culm, Inflorescence lax, widely spreading, branches drooping, pendulous, Inflorescence with 2-10 branches, Flowers bisexual, Spikelets pedicellate, Spikelets laterally compressed, Spikelet less than 3 mm wide, Spikelets with 1 fertile floret, Spikelets solitary at rachis nodes, Spikelets all alike and fertille, Spikelets bisex ual, Spikelets disarticulating above the glumes, glumes persistent, Spikelets disarticulating beneath or between the florets, Rachilla or pedicel glabrous, Glumes present, empty bracts, Glumes 2 clearly present, Glumes equal or subequal, Glumes equal to or longer than adjacent lemma, Glumes 1 nerved, Lemma coriaceous, firmer or thicker in texture than the glumes, Lemma 3 nerved, Lemma glabrous, Lemma apex acute or acuminate, Lemma distinctly awned, more than 2-3 mm, Lemma with 3 awns, Lemma awns about equal in length, Lemma awn 2-4 cm long or longer, Lemma awned from tip, Lemma awn once geniculate, bent once, Lemma margins inrolled, tightly covering palea and caryopsis, Lemma straight, Callus or base of lemma evidently hairy, Callus hairs shorter than lemma, Palea present, well developed, Palea membranous, hyaline, Palea shorter than lemma, Palea 2 nerved or 2 keeled, Stamens 3, Styles 2-fid, deeply 2-branched, Stigmas 2, Fruit - caryopsis, Caryopsis ellipsoid, longitudinall y grooved, hilum long-linear."], "py/object": "__main__.Species"}, {"thumbs_list": ["http://media.eol.org/content/2009/05/19/22/36518_98_68.jpg", "http://media.eol.org/content/2009/05/19/22/46714_98_68.jpg"], "common_name": "Camouflage grouper", "scientific_name": "Epinephelus polyphekadion (Bleeker, 1849)", "images_list": ["http://media.eol.org/content/2009/05/19/22/36518_orig.jpg", "http://media.eol.org/content/2009/05/19/22/46714_orig.jpg"], "web_url": "http://www.eol.org/pages/204639", "text_list": ["Usually found in coral-rich areas of lagoon and outer reefs; in caves and large crevices to swim through (Ref. 48635).

Associated unimale groups cluster into bands that may travel in the same area, although membership is flexible and unimale groups have been known to travel with several different bands at different times or even alone (6) (7). Bands in turn aggregate in large temporary herds that come together usually during the dry season for grazing (6) (7). Outside of these social organisations are all-male bachelor groups, which forage on their own and sleep separately from the unimale groups (6) (7). Males from bachelor groups will challenge males of unimale groups for tenure of their harem, and thereby access to breeding females. Within unimale groups, female bonds are very strong, and the females will try to stay together even if the male of their group dies (6).&nbsp;There is no defined breeding season, but a birth peak has been noted during the rainy season. Females usually give birth to a single infant at a time, after a gestation of five to six months. Females attain sexual maturity at around four or five years of age, whereas it takes five to seven years for males to fully mature (7).&nbsp;The diet of this species depends on seasonal availability, but consists largely of grasses, with the blades, seeds and bulbs all being eaten (6) (7). Grasses are picked by rapid, dextrous hand movements as the gelada sits and shuffles along the ground (8), but the species is also reported to eat fruit, flowers, leaves, insects (6) and even small mammals (2).", "Although often referred to as gelada baboons, these monkeys actually belong to a separate genus and are not true baboons. They are in fact the only member of their genus and the last surviving species of a once widespread group of grass-grazing primates (4) (5). The gelada can be easily recognised by the unusual hairless patches of skin on the chest, which blaze a bright crimson colour when females are in oestrus. Since this species spends long periods sitting whilst foraging for food, the usual sexual cue of red sexual swellings around the genitals would be difficult to see. Thus, by mimicking these sexual swellings, these more conspicuous chest patches serve as a highly visible signal of sexual receptivity (6). The coat is short and brown with a tuft of hair at the tip of the tail, and the adult male's shoulders are cloaked by a large cape-like mantle or mane (6) (7). The muzzle is deeply grooved with longitudinal ridges, and the upper lip can be everted in flash displays of communication (5), just as the contrasting pale eyelids against the dark face are also used for communicative expression (7)."], "py/object": "__main__.Species"}, {"thumbs_list": ["http://media.eol.org/content/2013/03/08/13/77352_98_68.jpg", "http://media.eol.org/content/2012/06/15/06/27467_98_68.jpg"], "common_name": "Greater Adjutant", "scientific_name": "Leptoptilos dubius (Gmelin, 1789)", "images_list": ["http://media.eol.org/content/2013/03/08/13/77352_orig.jpg", "http://media.eol.org/content/2012/06/15/06/27467_orig.jpg"], "web_url": "http://www.eol.org/pages/1049154", "text_list": ["Gathering in compact colonies at the start of the dry season in October, the greater adjutant nests on large, widely branched trees with few leaves (4).

Breeding pairs are monogamous, and usually return to the same nest every year. Egg-laying commences around November, with the female usually producing a clutch of two eggs of unequal size (2). Although, in general, only the chick from the larger egg survives to maturity, populations on the Falkland Islands frequently succeed in raising both (5). Incubation takes around 33 days, with both parent birds taking it in turns to sit on the eggs for extended periods of a time, whilst the other forages for food. Incubation is aided by a bare patch of skin on the lower abdomen (known as a 'brood pouch') that allows greater heat transfer to the egg. Once hatched, the male will remain to brood the chick for the first 25 days, whilst the female regularly brings food back to the nest. After this time, the chick is able to leave the nest, and will congregate with other chicks in small groups known as 'cr\u00e8ches' whilst the parent birds forage (2).&nbsp;In order to maintain its waterproof coat, the southern rockhopper penguin engages in frequent grooming, which helps to flatten the feathers and to spread a waxy substance that is secreted just below the tail. Grooming is also an important social bond between pairs. After breeding the southern rockhopper penguin forages extensively in order to build up fat reserves in preparation for its annual moult. It takes around 25 days for the penguin's coat to be fully replaced, at which point it leaves the land and spends the winter months foraging at sea, before returning to shore to breed in the following spring (2). The diet of the southern rockhopper penguin is composed of a variety of oceanic species, such as crustaceans, squid, octopus and fish (4). Groups may often feed together and dives may be to depths of up to 100 metres (2).", "Previously classed as a single species, the rockhopper penguin has now been split into a northern (Eudyptes moseleyi) and southern species (Eudyptes chrysocome) (3).

When perched, it is far more inconspicuous (5), an important component of its efficient hunting strategy.  From a perch it will scan the surrounding forest and ground for suitable prey (2), which includes a wide range of birds, including macaws, parrots, toucans and chickens; mammals, such as kinkajous, agoutis, squirrels and rats; and occasionally reptiles, such as iguanas and snakes (2).

The nests of this species are difficult to spot, as they are typically situated high in the forest (7), protected from potential predators on the ground (2).  The nest is constructed from sticks, measuring up to 1.7 metres across (7), and it is into this structure that the female lays a single egg (2).  The egg is incubated for around 48 days, mostly by the female (2), and when the young hatches, the male will hunt and deliver the food to the female who will then feed the chick (2).  When the young is about three weeks old, the female will begin hunting herself, and when the chick fledges at between 66 and 93 days, the female will then ignore her offspring (2).&nbsp;The male then takes over the rest of the care and will bring food to the chick until it can hunt for itself.  The young ornate hawk-eagle begins learning its sophisticated hunting technique by attacking fruit, diving and snatching at the food to practice this art.  It is often not until the juvenile is a year old that it can catch live prey, at which point the chick will leave the nest and territory of the parents (8).

This pouch also conceals the anus (Kohncke, 1986).The name ferox refers to its exaggerated reputation of being fierce (Gotch, 1979).The vernacular name \u2018fossa\u2019 or \u2018foussa\u2019 is a Malagasy name and is often confused with the generic name of Fossa fossana, the Malagasy civet. The 2 are not closely related (Nowak, 2005). The vernacular name may also be spelt as \u2018fosa\u2019 (Kohncke, 1986).The taxonomy of the Malagasy carnivores is problematic and the classification for Cryptoprocta ferox is still in debate (Wilson, 2005).MorphologyCryptoprocta ferox has several features similar to the Felidae. The dentition is characteristic of advanced carnivores - the carnassials are enlarged and there is one reduced upper molar. The skull has a shortened braincase and enlarged orbits (Ewer 1973).Scent glandsThe anal scent glands produce a pungent odour when the animal is aggravated (Nowak, 2005).Cryptoprocta ferox also has chest glands that fully develop upon sexual maturity.

Unlike other members of the Viverridae family, the fossa walks on the soles of its feet; a method of locomotion known as 'plantigrade'. The short, retractable claws also enable efficient tree climbing (4). One of the more unique peculiarities of the fossa is the fact that adolescent females go through a 'masculinisation' phase during their development; the clitoris becomes enlarged and covered in spines thus resembling the male penis, and there is an orange secretion on their underbelly which is usually only seen in mature males (2)."], "py/object": "__main__.Species"}, {"thumbs_list": ["http://media.eol.org/content/2014/06/09/17/19485_98_68.jpg", "http://media.eol.org/content/2011/11/01/14/90463_98_68.jpg"], "common_name": "Common nettle", "scientific_name": "Urtica dioica L.", "images_list": ["http://media.eol.org/content/2014/06/09/17/19485_orig.jpg", "http://media.eol.org/content/2011/11/01/14/90463_orig.jpg"], "web_url": "http://www.eol.org/pages/595063", "text_list": ["The common or stinging nettle is a well-known and highly successful 'weed' species (4).

However, its dependence on short grass, together with its need to drink at least every other day, limits the species to moist grassland and to areas within reach of water (4) (8), although interestingly it is also known to survive in waterless regions of the Kalahari by feeding on melons and water-storing roots and tubers (4). The need to follow seasonal grazing and water supplies leads the blue wildebeest to form some of the largest migratory herds of all antelopes, with those in the Serengeti-Masai Mara ecosystem of Kenya and Tanzania forming part of the world's largest remaining aggregations of large land mammals (4). However, not all wildebeest migrate, with some remaining in the same area year-round, generally forming small herds of up to ten females plus immature offspring (2) (4). The females in these herds tend to establish dominance hierarchies and harass any outsiders who attempt to join. In contrast, the only stable associations in migratory herds are between a female and offspring. Depending on the environmental conditions, different blue wildebeest populations, and even the same population at different times, may show every variation between these social extremes (4).&nbsp;The blue wildebeest has an unusually restricted breeding season. Around 80 to 90 percent of calves are born within a two to three week period, usually at the start of the rains, when conditions are most favourable (2) (4). This also helps to protect the calves by creating a glut for predators. The female blue wildebeest gives birth annually, to a single calf, after a gestation period of around eight months. The calf follows the female from the moment it can stand, usually within 15 minutes of birth, and is weaned by nine months (2). The young male is pushed out of the herd by territorial males after the first year, after which it joins a bachelor herd, which may also contain older and non-territorial males (2) (4). After reaching sexual maturity at three to four years old, the male becomes solitary and attempts to establish its own territory, which may be temporary in migratory populations, or may be continuously occupied and defended for years (2). Territorial competition between males typically involves ritualised displays, pushing with the horns, and the loud 'ge-nu' call that gives the wildebeest its other name, the gnu (2) (6). The lifespan of the blue wildebeest is around 20 years in the wild (3).", "The Makgadikgadi spiny agama (Agama hispida makarikarika) is endemic to the Makgadikgadi Pans complex within the Botswana element of the Zambezian halophytics ecoregion.

Countershading allows for birds to reduce the contrast between their shape and the surrounding environment, therefore aiding in concealment.  Generally, greater contrast in coloration of a bird reflects a greater illumination from above (Thayer, 1909).\r\n\r\nTree Swallows are unique in that first year females display delayed plumage maturation, appearing a dull brown dorsally although they are sexually mature.  By contrast, first year males do not display delayed plumage maturation and appear blue-green dorsally in their first year.  They, too are sexually mature although evidence suggests that they are not as successful as returning males at securing a mate (Thompson, 1991).  Although there is no delay in male plumage maturation, it is believed that as males mature, their plumage becomes brighter to optimally reflect light at a shorter wave-length (blue). Additionally, evidence suggests that males who appear more green may express lower nest fidelity and/or a lower survival rate than do their blue counterparts.  Therefore both brightness and hue may be reflective of male quality in Tree Swallows (Bitton and Dawson, 2008).\r\n\r\nThis is further supported by the knowledge that iridescence in color is a function of both the number and quality of feather barbules while hue is a function of the thickness of the feather cortex (Doucet et al., 2006, Prum, 2006).

A single young is born after a gestation period of around eight months, and remains amongst the dense grass cover in which it was born for the next two months (2).

For example, body temperature is 38 degrees Celsius, about 2 degrees Celsius lower than most birds (4), but within the normal range for many mammals (5). Kiwis also have an excellent sense of smell, one of the most developed among birds, aided by the unique placement of the nostrils at the end of the bill (5). Kiwis feed by jabbing the bill into the soil to search for insects and worms, this causes the nostrils to become clogged, and requires vigorous blowing and sneezing to clear them again (4).&nbsp;The tokoeka is highly territorial and has been known to attack humans when defending its territory (3). Unlike most other kiwis, which tend be more solitary, the tokoeka lives in family groups occupying a shared territory, the size of which depends on food abundance (4).&nbsp;Egg laying begins in July, continuing through to November in the Stewart Island populations and December in the South Island populations (5). A single egg is laid within a small burrow, and both parent birds and other birds within the family share incubation duties. This is a useful behaviour, since the incubation time is extremely long, usually between 70 and 80 days (4). During this time the males and females shed feathers from the breast, leaving a naked patch that is thought to help transfer heat to the egg during incubation. The chicks, which hatch fully fledged, leave the nest at one week old, but will remain in the family territory for up to seven years (5).", "The tokoeka is one of five recognised species of kiwi, the iconic, flightless birds that are only found in New Zealand (3). This species is divided into two distinct, geographically separated races commonly known as the southern tokoeka and the Haast tokoeka. Both races have the distinctive kiwi features, a pear-shaped body that lacks a tail, and wings that are so reduced that they are barely noticeable. The plumage appears to be almost hair-like, a result of the loose structure of the feathers, which do not lock together as in other birds. Colouration varies between the two races, with the Haast tokoeka having reddish-brown plumage, while the southern tokoeka is grey-brown with black streaks. The kiwi's long, slender bill is unusual compared to other birds, in that it has nostrils at its tip. While both races of tokoeka have an ivory coloured bill, the southern tokoeka's bill is straight, whereas the bill of the Haast tokoeka, in contrast to all other kiwis, is markedly down-curved (4). In the wild, the tokoeka can be easily identified by its call, in the male this is a shrill ascending and descending whistle, while in the female it is lower-pitched and hoarse (2)."], "py/object": "__main__.Species"}, {"thumbs_list": ["http://media.eol.org/content/2015/01/20/18/53033_98_68.jpg", "http://media.eol.org/content/2013/01/07/04/92525_98_68.jpg"], "common_name": "Loggerhead Shrike", "scientific_name": "Lanius ludovicianus Linnaeus 1766", "images_list": ["http://media.eol.org/content/2015/01/20/18/53033_orig.jpg", "http://media.eol.org/content/2013/01/07/04/92525_orig.jpg"], "web_url": "http://www.eol.org/pages/1050634", "text_list": ["The Loggerhead Shrike (Lanius ludovicianus), the only member of the Family Laniidae, is a predatory songbird of North America.

They are largely solitary (2) and though once thought to be nocturnal (6), are now known to be active during the day (2). They feed largely on leaves, grasses, fruits and fungi, some of which are known to be poisonous. It has been suggested that this is why okapis eat charcoal from burned forest trees, as is evidenced from their dung (2). Carbon, in the form of charcoal, is an excellent antidote for toxin ingestion and recent observations in Zanzibar found red colobus monkeys eating charcoal from native cooking fires and kilns (7). It is also known that many other animals find sources of kaolin, a type of clay, to offset the effects of poisonous leaves and fruit in their diet.&nbsp;Male and female okapi live in home ranges, but they are not territorial and these ranges overlap (3). From observations on captive animals, it appears that male okapis mark their ranges with urine, by crossing their front legs, urinating on them, and then walking through their range. They will also urinate directly onto plants. Both males and females rub their necks against tree trunks (3).&nbsp;Mothers will not stray very far after giving birth, so the young okapi will remain close by until at least a few days old, in what is known as a 'follower phase' (3). It then becomes a 'nester' for a number of months, in which it lies in vegetation. During this intensive nesting phase, the calf is extremely efficient in the use of energy, primarily only nursing or sleeping. Towards the end of the intensive nesting phase, the calf can maintain its temperature properly, and so activates its rumens, and defecates for the first time (3). This is thought to be a defence against predators (2). Okapi mothers use infrasonic communication to communicate with their calves. This is sound that is below the range of human hearing \u2013 also used by elephants (3).&nbsp;The young are weaned at six months old although they may continue to take milk for some time afterwards. The males begin developing their horns at about one year and reach their adult size at the age of three. They are believed to reach sexual maturity around two years old (2).

Cleavers has up to 8 leaves per whorl, while other Bedstraws usually have only 4 or 6 leaves per whorl. The carpels, leaves, and stems of Cleavers have an abundance of stiff hairs that can cling readily to clothing, fur, or adjacent vegetation; this distinguishes it from about one-half of the other Bedstraws, which have smooth to slightly rough carpels and foliage. Another species with white flowers, Galium mollugo (Hedge Bedstraw), has whorls of 6-8 leaves like Cleavers. However, Hedge Bedstraw has smooth carpels and foliage and it produces a large terminal inflorescence with an abundance of flowers. In the past, various Bedstraws were used to curdle milk in the production of cheese because the foliage is somewhat acidic."], "py/object": "__main__.Species"}, {"thumbs_list": ["http://media.eol.org/content/2014/12/12/18/64037_98_68.jpg", "http://media.eol.org/content/2014/11/17/00/77239_98_68.jpg"], "common_name": "monkfish", "scientific_name": "Squatina squatina (Linnaeus, 1758)", "images_list": ["http://media.eol.org/content/2014/12/12/18/64037_orig.jpg", "http://media.eol.org/content/2014/11/17/00/77239_orig.jpg"], "web_url": "http://www.eol.org/pages/212965", "text_list": ["This article is about the species.  For the genus, see angel shark.Squatina squatina, the angelshark or monkfish, is a species of shark in the family Squatinidae (known generally also as angel sharks), once widespread in the coastal waters of the northeastern Atlantic Ocean. Well-adapted for camouflaging itself on the sea floor, the angelshark has a flattened form with enlarged pectoral and pelvic fins, giving it a superficial resemblance to a ray. This species can be identified by its broad and stout body, conical barbels, thornless back (in larger individuals), and grayish or brownish dorsal coloration with a pattern of numerous small light and dark markings (that is more vivid in juveniles). It measures up to 2.4&#160;m (7.9&#160;ft) long.", "With its exceptionally flat body and large pectoral fins, the angel shark resembles a large ray more than a shark.  Its skin is grey to reddish or greenish-brown, scattered with small white spots and blackish dots.  Young angel sharks may also have white net-like markings and large, dark blotches, whilst adults are plainer (3).  The dorsal fins have a dark leading edge and a pale trailing edge.  It possesses simple, whisker-like projections near the nostrils, (nasal barbels), which are used to taste and feel (3).  Large, round eyes with vertical slit pupils provide good all-round vision, enabling the angel shark to be an efficient ambush predator (4)."], "py/object": "__main__.Species"}]
